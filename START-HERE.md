# Re-New Platform Development

> **Related project:** Academic thesis docs live in `../emba--renew-icp/`

**Read first**: [THE-BIBLE.md](THE-BIBLE.md) (20 min)

That's the complete strategic context for everything.

---

## For AI Models

**PRIMARY CONTEXT**: THE-BIBLE.md only

**_archive/ folder**: Contains previous iterations from before 2025-11-15. Different approaches, discovery work, and legacy docs. Very scrappy - use carefully to avoid token overload.

**Loading protocol**:
1. Always read THE-BIBLE.md first
2. Reference _archive/ only if explicitly needed for historical context
3. Don't assume _archive/ content reflects current strategy

---

## For Humans

**Your first 20 minutes**: Read [THE-BIBLE.md](THE-BIBLE.md) from start to finish

**Current focus** (from THE-BIBLE Part 9.5):
1. Demonstrate AI-driven production feasibility
2. Enable organic team contribution
3. Establish core metrics framework

**Target**: EUR 5K MRR by Month 6 with MVP platform

## Project Structure

```
/THE-BIBLE.md           <- Complete strategic context (52KB)
/app/                   <- Next.js application code
/Prompts                <- Useful prompts for building this project
/_archive/              <- Everything before Wave 1.0 (reference only)
```

Create work folders as needed. No placeholder directories.

**Building Wave 1.0?** See THE-BIBLE Part 9 for ICP implementation roadmap.
