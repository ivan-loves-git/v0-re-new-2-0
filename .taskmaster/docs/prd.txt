# Re-New Platform - Product Requirements Document (V1)

## 1. Overview

Re-New is a consulting company helping "repreneurs" (entrepreneurs acquiring businesses) find and acquire companies. This platform replaces their current ATS (Flatchr) with a purpose-built internal CRM for managing repreneur relationships and consulting services.

**Timeline:** 8-10 FTE working days
**Target Users:** 3 internal Re-New team members (1 full-time, 2 part-time)

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Backend/Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + API)
- **Hosting:** Vercel

### Build Approach
1. **Phase 1 (V0):** Core app — auth, schema, repreneurs CRUD, dashboard
2. **Phase 2 (Export):** Push to GitHub, clone locally
3. **Phase 3 (Claude Code):** Scoring, activity tracking, offer management, Flatchr import, fixes, polish, deploy

## 3. Authentication

- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- 3 users, all with equal access (no role-based permissions in V1)
- User identity tracked for audit purposes (who added notes, etc.)
- Users created manually in Supabase dashboard (no self-registration)

## 4. Data Model

A repreneur is a candidate/client managed over their entire lifecycle.

**Fields:**
- id (UUID, primary key)

### 4.2 Lifecycle Status (Action-Driven)
Status is **automatically derived from actions**, not manually set:

- **Qualified:** Automatically triggered when Tier 2 star rating (1-5) is set by Re-New team
- **Client:** Automatically triggered when one or more offers are assigned to the candidate

**Tier 1 - Pre-Interview (Automated):**
- Calculated from form data based on Bertrand's Excel scoring model

- Used to prioritize which leads to interview first

**Tier 2 - Post-Interview (Manual):**
