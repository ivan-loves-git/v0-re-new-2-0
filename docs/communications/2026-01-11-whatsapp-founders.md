## Message 1 (Response + Scheduling)

Hi all. I'm glad the work is being appreciated :) thanks for that. Special thanks Antoine for the thoughtful reflections. Not getting into the merit of these right now, but seeing structured and forward-looking thoughts being sparked by the work done is genuinely the best compliment I could ask for. It means the platform is doing its job: making things visible enough that we can think strategically about them.

Team, I'm a bit on the run from now to Wednesday (tight deadlines on other fronts), so if it works for you, I'd love to schedule a 45 min platform call for Thursday. My availability: morning 11:30-13:30, or afternoon 16:00-18:00. Let me know what works best on your side and I'll block it.

## Message 2 (Changelog)

Oh... well... meanwhile, knowing I wouldn't be able to supervise them, I've put my AI agents to good use today. Below the new features cooked. All needs refinement, but until we pick our road, I'm setting things up broadly.

🌊 *Wave update (51 commits in 48h)*

*Structured Readiness Journey*
Built out the milestone system we discussed. 11 checkboxes grouped by stage transition (Explorer → Learner → Ready → Serial). Journey stage now auto-derives from milestone count instead of manual selection. The idea: clear progression path, less ambiguity on "where is this person."

_Important: milestone labels are placeholders. Review together before launch._

*List view polish*
The repreneurs table was getting messy with 93 records. Added per-group pagination, sorting, and auto-collapse for empty groups. Fixed the column width bug where long emails broke the layout.

*Avatar & documents*
Fixed the avatar upload (was broken). CV and LDC now uploadable from intake form. Documents card on profile to manage both.

*Tier 1 inline editing*
All 15 questionnaire answers now editable directly on profile page. No need to re-run the wizard for corrections. Score recalculates automatically.

*Scoring algorithm fix*
Found a bug: when you edited scoring criteria in /guide/evaluation, it wasn't actually affecting new intakes. Fixed. Admin edits now properly flow through to the scoring.
