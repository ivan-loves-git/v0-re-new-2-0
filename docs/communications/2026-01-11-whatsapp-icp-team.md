Hey team, just to keep you in the loop 👋

The last few days I had some time and knew the next ones would be tight, so I pushed hard on the platform side. Three main pillars:

*1. Polish & debugging*
Fixed a bunch of annoying stuff: avatar uploads, table layouts breaking with long emails, scoring not updating properly. The small things that make a platform feel solid.

*2. Data import*
Got 93 historical repreneurs imported from Flatchr. Platform is no longer empty, which means real work can actually happen on it now.

*3. New features live*
- CV and profile photo uploads
- Full document management (upload, view, replace, delete)
- Email automations finally working
- Improved rating system with inline editing

Below a quick changelog. Full roadmap with all details here: https://v0-re-new-2-0.vercel.app/guide/roadmap

🌊 *51 commits in 48h, build 173, ~75% to v1.0*

Platform is fully accessible to you btw. Feel free to poke around, break things, get your hands dirty. Any feedback, suggestions, or "this feels weird" moments are gold at this stage 🙏
