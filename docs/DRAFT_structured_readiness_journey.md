# Why a Structured Readiness Journey is a Strategic Asset

Following our conversation, I want to revisit the journey stages and Tier 2 discussion. I think we're circling around something important without fully landing on it.

The core issue isn't the labels or the number of stars. It's this: what does Re-New actually know about its candidates, and how do we make that knowledge visible? Right now, a candidate fills out a questionnaire, gets a score, has an interview, gets some stars. But none of this tells them what Re-New sees, what's missing, or why a specific offer makes sense. From their perspective, it's a black box. From an intermediary's perspective, it's just "trust us."

##### That's fixable. But it requires thinking about assessment as a system, not a collection of independent fields.

## The Problem with the Current Setup

**Journey stages are labels without criteria.**
What makes someone a "Learner" vs "Ready"? If it's just a judgment call, the label adds no value. It's decoration.

**Tier 2 collapses a 30-minute interview into one number.**
If someone gets 3 stars, what does that mean? Average at everything? Great leader but weak on financials? Strong communicator but unclear vision? A single rating loses all the signal.

**Nothing connects to action.**
The candidate sees a score but doesn't know what to do with it. You see stars but can't explain to an intermediary why this person is ready.

## The Proposed Solution: A Three-Tier Assessment System

### Tier 1: Background & Resources (Automated)

This stays as-is. The questionnaire produces a score (0-95) with breakdown by category. It answers the question: "What does this person bring to the table?" Experience, investment capacity, sector knowledge, M&A exposure. This layer works well and doesn't need major changes.

---

### Tier 2: Competency Profile (Interview-based)

Instead of reducing a 30-minute interview to a single star rating, we capture what the interview actually reveals: a multi-dimensional profile of the candidate's strengths and gaps.

After each interview, the team rates the candidate across six competency dimensions. Each dimension gets its own rating (1-5 stars), and an overall score is calculated as a weighted average. When viewing a candidate, the overall stars appear as a summary. Clicking on them reveals the full profile underneath.

**The Six Competency Dimensions:**

| Dimension | What it measures | Rating |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Leadership** | Can they run a company? Make hard decisions? Manage a team? | ●●●●○ |
| **Financial Acumen** | Do they understand deal structures, valuation, due diligence? | ●●○○○ |
| **Communication** | Can they negotiate with sellers? Present to banks and intermediaries? | ●●●●● |
| **Clarity of Vision** | Do they know what they're looking for? Clear target profile? | ●●●○○ |
| **Coachability** | Are they open to guidance? Do they follow advice? | ●●●●○ |
| **Commitment** | Is this a full-time pursuit? Do they have support (family, advisors)? | ●●●●● |
| **Overall** | Weighted average of all dimensions above | ●●●●○ |

This preserves simplicity for quick scanning (the overall stars) while capturing the nuance that actually matters. More importantly, it gives you something concrete to show the candidate and the intermediary.

### Tier 3: Readiness Verification (Milestones)

Tier 1 measures who the candidate is. Tier 2 measures how they come across. But neither answers the most practical question: have they actually done the preparation work?

This is what Tier 3 addresses. It's not about judgment or scoring. It's a checklist of verifiable milestones that indicate real progress toward acquisition readiness. Each milestone is binary: either the evidence exists or it doesn't. There's no subjectivity.

The milestones should cover the key preparation steps that separate someone who is "thinking about acquiring" from someone who is "ready to acquire." Based on our conversations, these likely include things like having a defined investment thesis, confirmed financing, a clear target profile, and the right advisory support in place. The Lettre de Cadrage is obviously central, but there are other concrete markers that matter.

**Example Readiness Milestones:**

- Lettre de Cadrage completed and validated
- Investment thesis documented (sector, size, geography, deal criteria)
- Financing structure confirmed (personal equity + debt/investors)
- Target company profile defined (industry, revenue range, location)
- Advisory team in place (lawyer, accountant, M&A advisor)
- Has identified potential targets or is actively sourcing
- Completed Re-New training/workshop (if applicable)
- Search timeline established with realistic milestones

The readiness score is simply: "6/8 milestones complete." It's objective, verifiable, and defensible when an intermediary asks "how do you know this person is ready?"

## Why This Matters

### 1. For selling your services

"You should buy our Starter Pack" is weak.

"Your Tier 2 profile shows strong leadership but gaps in financial structuring. You've completed 3/8 readiness milestones. Our Starter Pack addresses exactly those 5 missing milestones and helps you build your Lettre de Cadrage."

That sells. You're diagnosing problems and offering solutions.

### 2. For intermediaries

What can you say today?
- "This is a good candidate, we talked to them, they seem ready"

What could you say with this system?
- "This candidate scored 72/95 on Tier 1. Their Tier 2 profile shows Leadership 4/5, Communication 5/5, Financial Acumen 3/5. They've completed 7/8 readiness milestones: validated Lettre de Cadrage, confirmed financing of €800k, defined target profile (manufacturing, €1-3M revenue, Rhône-Alpes). They are certified Ready-stage."

That's trust. That's what intermediaries can rely on. That's what makes Re-New different from anyone else sending warm bodies.

### 3. For candidates

Instead of "you got 3 stars" (meaningless), they see:

> "You're at **Learner** stage. Your strengths: leadership, communication, commitment. Your gaps: financial structuring, target definition. You've completed 4/8 readiness milestones. Here's the path to Ready: complete your Lettre de Cadrage, confirm financing, define target profile. Our Starter Pack helps you do exactly this."

They see value immediately. They understand WHY you're recommending something.

### 4. For journey stages

With this system, stages aren't assigned by gut feel. They're derived from data:

- **Explorer:** Low Tier 1, few milestones, unclear vision
- **Learner:** Medium Tier 1, working on milestones, in Starter Pack
- **Ready:** High Tier 1, key milestones complete, clear target profile
- **Advanced:** All above + active search, targets identified or LOIs sent

The label now means something.

## What This Requires from Re-New

The platform can display all of this. But the content must come from your expertise:

1. **Competency dimensions:** Are these six the right ones? What does 1 vs 5 look like for each?
2. **Readiness milestones:** What are the 8-10 things that define "truly ready"? The Lettre de Cadrage is clearly one. What are the others?
3. **Stage criteria:** What combination of Tier 1 + Tier 2 + milestones places someone in each stage?
4. **Offer mapping:** Which milestones does each offer (Starter Pack, Deal Flow, Sparring Partner) help complete?

I don't have these answers. You do.

## Suggested Next Step

Before the workshop with Antoine, I'd recommend you and Amelie spend 30 minutes listing:
- The 10 things a candidate needs to be "truly ready" to acquire
- Which can be verified (document exists, test passed, call completed)
- Which of your offers help with which gaps

Once you have that, we can build it into the platform. Without it, the journey stages remain nice labels that don't drive value.
