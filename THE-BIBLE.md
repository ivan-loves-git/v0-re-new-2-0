## Part 1: RE-NEW WAVE 1.0 - Digital Platform Initiative

### Mission Statement

"Transform the European SME acquisition journey by providing acquisition entrepreneurs with a progressive digital platform that grows with them - from free self-discovery tools through professional deal analysis, community support, and expert connections."

### What is Re-New Wave 1.0?

Re-New Wave 1.0 is the technology platform that operationalizes and scales Re-New's acquisition entrepreneur support services. It represents:

- **Digital-First Approach**: Automated tools and self-service features that reduce manual workload
- **Progressive Engagement**: Free entry point expanding to premium services as users advance
- **Community Platform**: Connecting repreneurs with peers, mentors, and experts
- **Deal Flow Hub**: Centralized access to curated acquisition opportunities
- **Analysis Toolkit**: Professional tools for evaluating and pursuing deals

### Core Value Propositions

1. **For Repreneurs**: Start free, pay only for what you need, access everything in one place
2. **For Re-New**: Scale beyond personal capacity, create recurring revenue, build defensible moat
3. **For Partners**: Efficient deal distribution, qualified buyer connections, performance tracking

### Strategic Positioning

Wave 1.0 is not replacing Re-New's core consultative model but **amplifying it through technology**. It allows Bertrand and the team to:
- Serve 500+ repreneurs instead of 70
- Generate €50-100K monthly recurring revenue

### 9.5 Six-Month Platform Goals

The first six months focus on three strategic objectives that will determine the platform's viability and future direction.

#### Goal 1: Demonstrate AI-Driven Production Feasibility

**Objective**: Prove that AI-assisted development can deliver production-ready code, not just prototypes.

**Success Criteria**:
- Deploy a fully functional platform with Free, Professional, and Premium tiers
- Achieve 99.5%+ uptime with AI-built infrastructure
- Handle real user transactions and payments without critical failures
- Implement secure authentication, data protection, and GDPR compliance
- Ship features from conception to production in <2 weeks using AI assistance

**Why This Matters**: If successful, this validates a new development paradigm that could 10x future iteration speed while maintaining production quality standards. This transforms the economics of platform development for small teams.

**Measurement**:
- Production deployment date and stability metrics
- Feature velocity (time from idea to live feature)
- Critical bug count and resolution time
- Infrastructure cost per user vs. traditional development

---

#### Goal 2: Enable Organic Team Contribution

**Objective**: Create a platform architecture that allows ICP team members to contribute effectively within their limited time and specific expertise areas.

**Team Member Focus Areas**:

**Alex & Nacho** (Monetization & Discovery):
- Iterate on pricing experiments (Free → Professional → Premium conversion)
- Refine readiness assessment questions and scoring algorithms
- Design and test Lead de Cadrage variations to improve match quality
- Contribution mode: Strategic input on features, A/B test design, user research analysis

**Gabriele** (Data Acquisition & Deal Flow):
- Develop innovative data sourcing strategies to bypass boutique intermediaries
- Implement direct scraping or API integrations for deal data
- Build automated lead enrichment pipelines
- Create data quality scoring and validation systems
- Contribution mode: Technical implementation of data pipelines, automation scripts

**Ivan** (Platform Development & Integration):
- Orchestrate AI-assisted feature development
- Integrate team member contributions into cohesive platform
- Maintain technical architecture and deployment pipelines
- Ensure scalability and security standards

**Success Criteria**:
- Each team member ships at least one significant contribution within 6 months
- Contribution workflow requires <5 hours/month per person
- Features integrate cleanly without requiring extensive rework
- Team members report high satisfaction with contribution process

**Why This Matters**: Re-New Wave 1.0 must work with the team's reality—busy professionals with limited time. Success here means the platform becomes a sustainable team effort, not a solo project dependent on one person.

---

#### Goal 3: Establish Core Metrics Framework

**Objective**: Implement measurement infrastructure to track the 3-4 metrics that truly indicate platform health and product-market fit.

**Priority Metrics** (based on startup growth fundamentals):

**1. Activation Rate** (Primary - Weeks 1-8 Focus):
- % of signups who complete Lead de Cadrage within 7 days
- % who view at least 5 deals within 30 days
- % who upgrade from Free to paid tier within 60 days
- **Target**: 40% complete Lead de Cadrage, 15% view deals, 10% upgrade

**Why First**: Activation proves users find immediate value. Without activation, retention and revenue are impossible.

**2. Cohort Retention** (Primary - Months 2-6 Focus):
- Day 7, Day 30, Month 3 retention rates by tier
- Professional tier: >70% at 30 days, >50% at 3 months
- Premium tier: >85% at 30 days, >70% at 3 months
- **Target**: Demonstrate improving retention curves month-over-month

**Why Critical**: "You can't fix bad retention" - if users don't return, the business model fails. This is the #1 indicator of product-market fit.

**3. Revenue Growth** (Secondary - Months 3-6 Focus):
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) trajectory
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by tier
- Free → Professional → Premium conversion rates
- **Target**: €5,000 MRR by Month 6, proving monetization viability

**4. User Engagement** (Supporting - Continuous):
- Time spent on platform per visit
- Pages viewed per session
- Deal views, saves, and introduction requests
- Community participation (posts, messages, event attendance)
- **Target**: 15+ minutes per session (paid users), 3+ sessions per week

**Measurement Infrastructure**:
- Analytics platform (Mixpanel or Amplitude)
- Automated weekly reporting dashboards
- Monthly metric review sessions with team
- User feedback collection via in-app surveys (NPS, CSAT)

**Success Criteria**:
- All four metric categories tracked from Day 1
- Weekly automated reports delivered to team
- At least one metric shows positive trend by Month 3
- Team makes at least two data-driven product decisions within 6 months

**Why This Matters**: Metrics provide objective truth about what's working and what's not. They enable rapid iteration, prevent wasted effort on wrong features, and build team confidence through visible progress.

### 9.6 Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Start with proven technologies
- Build modular architecture
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Plan for scale from day one

**Business Risks**:
- Validate pricing early
- Test value propositions
- Maintain manual backup processes
- Keep acquisition costs low

**Market Risks**:
- Start with friendly users
