Purpose & context Ivan is the Digital Director leading the Scale-up workstream for Re-New 2.0, an EMBA Individual Consulting Project (ICP) focused on transforming manual candidate selection processes into automated platforms. The project operates in the "repreneurship" space and is structured as an academic consulting engagement with team-based coordination and regular tutor oversight from Professor Kupp. The team is organized into three workstreams: Scale & Refine (led by Ivan and Nacho, focusing on website and automation technology), Monetization (led by Alex, developing operating partner services), and Expansion (led by Piera and Gabriele, exploring growth opportunities). Key stakeholders include team leader Bertrand and board member Pierre Laurent, who has raised critical questions about expansion strategy and revenue projections. Success involves both delivering a functional automated platform and navigating the academic evaluation process, where strategic thinking and business model validation are as important as technical execution. Current state Ivan has successfully delivered a website relaunch and built an AI-powered screening platform using no-code tools like Flatchr during Re-New 1.0. The platform focuses on reducing cost per candidate screening and providing time-tracking for interview processes. However, Campaign #2 revealed a critical insight: the team faces a distribution problem rather than a technology problem, despite having automation infrastructure in place. The team is grappling with fundamental business model validation challenges rather than pure scaling, as highlighted by advisor feedback questioning their expansion approach. They've standardized on Notion for collaboration and maintain weekly meeting schedules with regular tutor check-ins. Key learnings & principles A major realization emerged from comparing Campaign #1 (which generated 60 candidates with zero marketing effort) to Campaign #2 (which didn't achieve expected candidate volumes despite automation infrastructure). This revealed the classic "product-market fit vs. product optimization" tension that technical co-founders face. The team has learned to distinguish between having impressive technology and having effective distribution - a critical insight that's reshaping their strategic priorities and resource allocation decisions. Approach & patterns Ivan approaches strategic challenges by developing structured option frameworks rather than presenting complaints about task assignments. He works to reframe technical decisions as business strategy questions, particularly around timing and resource allocation. The team maintains regular coordination through weekly meetings, uses Notion for collaboration, and engages actively with academic oversight to ensure both project success and favorable ICP evaluation. Ivan balances technical execution with strategic positioning, being mindful of how different approaches (deep AI work vs. growth engineering vs. platform building) might be perceived in the academic evaluation context.
