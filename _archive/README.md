## Important Notes

### For AI Models
- **Token management**: This folder is large and scrappy. Load selectively.
- **Strategy conflicts**: If OLD/ content contradicts THE-BIBLE.md, THE-BIBLE wins.
- **Evolution context**: Useful for understanding "why" decisions were made, not "what" to do now.

### For Humans
- Multiple strategic pivots occurred in 2024 (see 03_DECISION_LOG/ for history)
- Previous model focused on marketplace connecting candidates to deal makers
- Current model (Wave 1.0) focuses on SaaS platform serving entrepreneurs directly
- Pricing evolved from €30-750/month tiers to Free/€99/€249 + €1,250 Starter Pack

## Archive Date
All content moved to OLD/ on: **2025-11-15**

**Reason**: Clean slate for Re-New Wave 1.0 with THE-BIBLE.md as single reference.
