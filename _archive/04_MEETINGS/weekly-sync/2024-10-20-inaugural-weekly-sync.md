## 💬 Discussion Notes

### Topic 1: Weekly Meeting Cadence

**Context:** Team needed to establish regular sync schedule since not everyone could attend July meetings

**Discussion:**
- Google survey showed Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday 6-8 PM worked for most
- Monday 7-8 PM had best availability (3-4 people confirmed)
- Debate: Weekly vs. bi-weekly?
  - **Ivan's point:** Weekly gives flexibility to skip if busy; bi-weekly makes each meeting more critical
  - **Nacho's point:** October has more bandwidth; November will be constrained (seminars, Paris Global Horizon event)
  - **Alex's point:** Team is behind, need tighter collaboration initially
- **Consensus:** Weekly in October to build momentum, shift to bi-weekly in November due to travel/seminars

**Meeting Structure Agreed:**
- 45 minutes max (not full hour since it's weekly)
- 10-15 min: ICP/academic deliverables discussion
- 30 min: Round-table workstream updates
- Ad-hoc: Strategic discussions as needed

**Outcome:** Monday 7-8 PM weekly, starting immediately

---

### Topic 2: Tutor & Academic Engagement

**Context:** Team needs to establish relationship with tutor (Martin Kuh) and maintain alignment with Francesco

**Discussion:**
- Bertrand advised: Don't have separate meetings with Francesco and Martin Kuh
- Better to have joint meetings to avoid conflicting guidance
- Francesco meeting scheduled Oct 27 at 6 PM
- Should meet Martin Kuh BEFORE that meeting (week of Oct 20-24)

**Challenges:**
- Nacho has Madrid electives that week (one online balance, otherwise flexible)
- Ivan traveling for work (but available most days)
- Alex, Gabriele, Piera have Strategy & Project Management course Oct 21-22

**Outcome:** Alex to coordinate with Martin Kuh for availability and schedule

---

### Topic 3: Expansion Strategy Pivot

**Context:** Alex had 1:1 with Pierlorang and presented proposed ICP scope showing Italy expansion focus

**Pierlorang's Critical Feedback:**
- "Project not stable enough in France to expand internationally"
- "You can work on expansion but don't expect much short-term results"
- "As investor/board member, I don't believe in this direction yet"

**Key Insight Shared:**
- German competitor "Cairn" does ETA acquisition support (like Re-New)
- **Plus:** Family business succession as second revenue stream
- This was new information for Bertrand (Alex connected them)

**Team Reactions:**
- **Ivan:** "Very happy Cairn exists - validates business model. Understanding competitor is strategic. Family business is interesting, want to learn more."
- **Ivan:** "Always skeptical of Italy expansion operationally, but saw value in learning/networking"
- **Piera:** "We should scout opportunities first, not jump to conclusions. Italy might still be right, but let's evaluate."
- **Gabriele:** "Expansion doesn't mean just geography - could be business model expansion"
- **Nacho:** "Let's do proper process, not reverse-engineer conclusion"

**Refined Approach:**
- Expansion = exploring multiple growth opportunities (not just Italy)
- Could include: Geographic (Italy, other markets), Vertical (family business), Partnership models
- Scout → Validate → Commit (not commit → execute)

**Outcome:**
- Piera, Gabriele, Alex to meet separately and define exploration framework
- Present to Bertrand for validation (he's interested in family business angle)
- Update ICP scope to reflect broader exploration vs. Italy launch plan

---

### Topic 4: Team Structure & ICP Scope

**Context:** Alex prepared slides showing three workstreams (from Bertrand's previous materials)

**Proposed Structure:**
- **Stream 1 - Scale & Refine:** Nacho, Ivan (campaign execution, website, HR automation)
- **Stream 2 - Monetization:** Alex (operating partner pilot, revenue model)
- **Stream 3 - Expansion:** Piera, Gabriele (was Italy, now broader exploration)

**Ivan's Important Critique:**
- "This terminology implies we're a validated company ready to scale"
- "Reality: We're still searching for a validated business model"
- "We're not making money yet - that's the difference between good idea and good business"
- "Monetization stream is actually 'business model validation'"
- "Scale & Refine is actually 'cost reduction' more than scaling up"

**Team Acknowledgment:**
- Pierlorang made same point: "Nice projections but you're not profitable"
- This framing is for internal organization, not external presentation
- All three streams are interconnected until business model is validated

**Outcome:**
- Keep structure for now (practical for organizing work)
- Be honest in academic deliverables about validation stage
- All streams ultimately feed into finding validated business model

### Topic 5: Notion as Primary Collaboration Tool

**Context:** Ivan has been building Re-New workspace in Notion; not everyone comfortable with tool

**Ivan's Current Usage:**
- Repository for website content
- Branding & positioning documentation
- Strategy documents
- Individual contribution pages (strengths, focus areas)
- Two workspaces: Ivan's paid account (current) + Bertrand's free account

**Team Concerns:**
- **Alex:** "I'm read-only, can't add anything, need training"
- **Piera:** "Need training session, not familiar with Notion"
- **Nacho:** "How do we collaborate on files? Can we compile ICP report in Notion?"

**Ivan's Pitch:**
- Notion is very flexible (database, AI connections, public websites, etc.)
- Learning curve is short (5 minutes to learn basics)
- **Key advantage:** AI integration - can connect ChatGPT/Claude to Notion as knowledge base
- Example: "Claude, learn everything in Re-New Notion, then analyze competitor Cairn"

**Ivan's Pragmatic Take:**
- "Use what works for your task - we can easily import into Notion"
- "Don't learn new tools just for sake of it"
- "But Notion is valuable for ICP because learning new tools is part of program"

**Gabriele's Endorsement:**
- "Notion is revolutionary - saw company adopt it in one week vs. years for other tools"
- "Combines Excel, PowerPoint, website dev in one tool"

**Outcome:**
- Notion is primary collaboration tool
- Ivan will do 5-minute basics training at next sync
- Team can keep using Google Docs/Sheets and import to Notion if preferred
- Ivan granted edit access during meeting

### Topic 6: ICP Leadership & Milestones

**Context:** Ivan raised need for someone to be accountable for ICP deliverables

**Ivan's Proposal:**
- Need an ICP leader/coordinator to track academic requirements
- Should have regular ICP discussion time in weekly meetings (10-15 min)
- Need to define ICP milestones and timeline

**Ivan's Self-Assessment:**
- "I'm good with AI but not with bureaucracy"
- Implied: Happy to help but might not be best leader

**Key Milestone Proposed:**
- **Late November:** Review Campaign #2 results
- When: Paris seminar trip (Re-New event + workshop)
- What: Analyze Campaign #2 (CVs received, quality, candidate needs)
- Why: Inform Campaign #3 strategy

**Outcome:**
- Defer ICP leader selection to next meeting (need time to think)
- All agree need for leadership and structure
- Will dedicate agenda time for ICP at each weekly sync

---

### Topic 7: Platform & AI Development (Brief Update from Ivan)

**Context:** Ivan has been building HR automation platform; team wanted full demo

**Ivan's Update:**
- Platform built in React (very basic/rough currently)
- Will run in parallel to Campaign #2 (manual process continues)
- Goal: Full transition to platform for Campaign #3
- Purpose: Lower costs, give team (Nacho, Amelie) creative space, competitive advantage

**Demo Plans:**
- Ivan offered demo today if time permits
- Team decided to postpone to next meeting (prioritize setup discussions first)
- Will allocate 10-15 minutes at upcoming sync

**Notion Platform Page:**

## 📝 Raw Notes / Additional Context

**Meeting Tone:**
- Collaborative and constructive
- Strong alignment on being realistic about stage (validation, not scale)
- Healthy debate on expansion strategy
- Team comfortable challenging each other and giving feedback

**Pierlorang's Role:**
- Investor/board member
- Provides experienced startup/investment perspective
- Meeting with him requires preparation (Alex did slides in advance)
- His feedback carries weight but team also thinks independently

**Team Dynamics:**
- Ivan: Technical lead, strategic thinker, self-aware about strengths/weaknesses
- Alex: External liaison (Bertrand, investors, academics), monetization focus
- Nacho: Campaign execution, pragmatic, focused on October push
- Piera: Strategic exploration, networking, Italy context
- Gabriele: Strategic support, tech-curious (AI, tools)

**Academic Context:**
- This is an ICP (Individual Competency Project) for business school
- Team replaced previous "Re-New 1.0" team
- Have tutor (Martin Kuh) and academic advisor (Francesco)
- Deliverables and timeline TBD but important to define soon

**Key Quote (Ivan):**
"If no one else is doing what you're doing, it's actually one of the biggest signs of risk. If no one has figured it out with 7 billion people, it's a big red flag. So I'm super happy that Cairn exists."

**Key Quote (Pierlorang, via Alex):**
"The project is not stable enough in France to expand. You can work on expansion but from my experience as investor/board member, you may not be able to achieve much in the short term."
