## 📌 Quick Summary

Major strategic debrief following Campaign #2 completion. Core insight: Re-New is not recruiting "candidates" but managing "repreneurs" (entrepreneurs seeking to acquire businesses). This requires shifting from ATS (Applicant Tracking System) mindset to CRM (Customer Relationship Management). Discussion covered monetization strategy (dual approach: sell repreneurs to partners + sell services to repreneurs), operational tooling needs, and deal flow matching automation. Bertrand managing 35+ repreneurs and needs scalable back-office system.

## 📊 Campaign #2 Major Learnings

### Core Insight: We're Not Recruiting, We're Managing Repreneurs

**Amelie's framing:**
> "The major outcome of the campaign is... we are not dealing with candidates actually, because we do not provide any kind of job opportunities. We are dealing with repreneurs. These repreneurs can be either **products that we may sell to a partner** (who is searching for profiles), or they are **customers** (because we will need to have them as customers of our different services)."

**Implication:**
- **Campaign = marketing tool**, not core business model
- Keep campaigns 1-2x/year for LinkedIn buzz, but not primary repreneur sourcing
- Focus shifts to: identifying repreneurs → proposing solutions → monetizing relationships

**What Changed from Campaign #1 to Campaign #2:**
- **Last year:** "Real HR, quite boring interviews" (screening for fit)
- **This year:** "Conversations where candidates challenge us" (consultative, value-driven)
- Repreneurs ask: "What can you provide me?" (not "Will you select me?")
- Enlightened Re-New on gaps and unclear value propositions

---

### Lead de Cadrage: The "Magical Key"

**What it is:**
Structured document that profiles the repreneur's acquisition project (not just resume):
- Who is the person?
- What acquisition project? (sector, region, deal size)
- Professional background and skills
- Target company characteristics (metrics, purchase price)
- Financing capacity (how much capital can they bring?)
- Acquisition structure (majority vs. minority stake)

**Strategic Importance:**
- **Bertrand:** "Without this doc, it means you've not started thinking really about your project. You've not started to structure it."
- **Mandatory entry requirement:** No repreneur can access Re-New services without completing Lead de Cadrage
- **Enables matching:** Structured data allows pairing repreneur profiles with deal flow opportunities
- **Quality filter:** Demonstrates seriousness and readiness

**Current Challenge:**
- Lead de Cadrage is PDF (unstructured data)
- AI struggles to parse PDFs effectively
- Need to convert to structured form (web form with database backend)

---

### Repreneur Segmentation by Journey Stage

**Amelie's insight:**
> "A repreneur has value for us depending on where they stand on the project."

**Stages identified:**
1. **Super early:** Exploring idea, not committed yet
2. **Quite early:** Committed to acquisition path, building knowledge
3. **Advanced:** Actively searching, ready to evaluate deals
4. **Super advanced:** In negotiation or closing phase

**Different offers for different stages:**
- Early stage: Education, coaching, network access
- Advanced stage: Deal flow access, introduction to partners, financing support
- Super advanced: Operating partner support, investment vehicle access

**Monetization varies by stage:**
- Early: Low-cost subscriptions or free (building relationship)
- Advanced: Deal success fees, partner commissions
- Post-acquisition: Operating partner fees, investment vehicle participation

## 💬 Discussion Notes

### Topic 1: ATS → CRM Pivot

**Context:** Amelie and Bertrand realized Airtable (current tool) is structured for applicant tracking, not customer relationship management.

**The Problem with ATS Mindset:**
- Focuses on: Resume screening, scoring, pass/fail decisions
- **Amelie:** "Everything that we did previously like the scoring, the matching, the resumes... in the end we don't give a shit. It's not very interesting."
- **What matters:** Lead de Cadrage (structured project profile), ongoing relationship, service delivery

**Why CRM is Needed:**
- Repreneurs are customers and/or products (dual role)
- Need to track: Relationship history, services delivered, monetization status, next actions
- Bertrand managing 35+ repreneurs: Can't track in spreadsheet
- **Amelie showing current Airtable:** Multiple tabs (List A, List B, List C, Bronze medalists, Silver medalists, Out of campaign, Follow-up) - "We cannot keep on working like this. This is not okay."

**CRM Requirements:**
- Manage repreneurs (not candidates)
- Track partners (M&A firms, brokers, lenders, operating partners)
- Define and track "offers" (services Re-New sells)
- Record actions taken (introductions made, coaching sessions, deals shared)
- Measure: Time invested, monetization potential, relationship stage

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Bertrand:** "At you [Airtable] as a CRM, I have an account. We can test it."
- Start with off-the-shelf CRM (Airtable, HubSpot, others)
- Customize for Re-New's specific needs
- Potentially build custom later if no solution fits

---

### Topic 2: Dual Monetization Strategy

**Context:** Re-New currently has no revenue. Need to validate business model urgently.

**Two Revenue Streams Being Tested:**

#### Stream 1: Sell Repreneurs to Partners (Current Focus)

**Model:** Partners pay Re-New for access to vetted, trained repreneurs
- M&A firm finds buyer through Re-New → pays commission on deal (€25K on €3M acquisition = ~1%)
- Re-New provides: Screening, training, readiness validation

**Challenges:**
- **Amelie:** "Maximum 20 partners per year... this is not a long-term enough way of monetization."
- Too few partners, too long sales cycles, too uncertain
- Need cash flow faster than this model can provide

#### Stream 2: Sell Services to Repreneurs (New Focus)

**Model:** Repreneurs pay Re-New for services across three layers:

**Layer 1: Deal Flow Access & Coaching**
- Selection, access to deal flow, personal network
- Currently free, should be monetized
- Proposed: €100/month for 2-month coaching package (example pricing)

**Layer 2: Operating Partner Support**
- Post-acquisition support (1-2 years)
- Help repreneur secure success after takeover
- Pricing TBD

**Layer 3: Investment Vehicle**
- Access to Re-New investment fund
- Co-investment opportunities
- Revenue share or carry model

**Strategic Debate:**

**Ivan's Challenge:**
> "Why are you trying to monetize both sides? One will cannibalize the other unless made very strategically. At some point you should probably choose where to focus."

**Ivan's Advice:**
- Platform strategy: Keep candidates (repreneurs) free if that brings more value on partner side
- Don't try to squeeze money from everyone
- Test both, but frame it as an experiment with time limit
- Measure: Who is actually willing to open their wallet?

**Amelie's Counter:**
> "We cannot make everything free for the candidate and partner at some point. Bertrand has spent an enormous quantity of hours following candidates, guiding them, sending opportunities, matching, etc. This should be monetized."

**Team Decision:**
- Test both streams simultaneously (3-6 month experiment)
- Measure: Willingness to pay, conversion rates, revenue potential
- Then choose primary monetization focus based on data

### Topic 3: Deal Flow Matching Automation

**Context:** Bertrand manually matches repreneurs to acquisition opportunities. Not scalable.

**The Matching Problem:**

**Inputs:**
1. **Repreneur profiles** (Lead de Cadrage): Sector preference, region, deal size, financing capacity
2. **Deal flow** (Teasers from partners): Anonymized company opportunities

**Current Process:**
- Bertrand receives PDF teasers from M&A firms
- Reviews against repreneur profiles
- Manually emails relevant repreneurs
- Facilitates intro if mutual interest
- Not scalable (35+ repreneurs, growing deal flow)

**Automation Opportunity:**
- Structured Lead de Cadrage data (web form → database)
- Structured deal flow data (parse teasers → database)
- Algorithm: Match preferences (sector, region, size) → notify repreneurs
- Potential: Build marketplace dashboard (like Dealmaker.fr)

**Ivan's Technical Exploration:**

**Dealmaker.fr Example:**
- Subscription-based deal flow platform (€250/year)
- M&A firms post anonymized teasers
- Buyers browse, sign NDAs, request contact
- **Ivan:** "This can be replicated within the scope of an ICP. It's feasible."

**Strategic Questions Ivan Raised:**

1. **Why matching vs. open dashboard?**
   - If you collect all deal data (hard work), why not let repreneurs browse?
   - Matching adds value if: Too many deals to browse, OR deals are secret IP
   - **Ivan:** "For 120 deals, they can scroll in 50 minutes. Matching isn't that much value unless you have thousands of deals."

2. **Where's the real value?**
   - Collecting fragmented, analog M&A data → structuring it
   - Small boutique M&A firms have no online presence
   - Repreneurs can't find these deals without Re-New aggregation
   - **Bertrand:** "Intermediaries are super niche, very small boutique, super analogic, not present on LinkedIn, vitrine website only."

3. **Will M&A firms give you data?**
   - **Ivan's advice:** "Fake it till you make it. Email 100 partners saying 'we're building a platform, click here to submit your deals.' See if anyone does it."
   - Validate demand before building complex matching system
   - If 0/100 respond, matching platform is wrong direction
   - If 20/100 respond, you have customers and clear need

**Bertrand's Current Reality:**
- Gets deals via personal outreach to M&A firms
- They send PDF teasers by email
- Signed umbrella NDA (Re-New won't leak IP)
- Teasers are anonymized (e.g., "Project Lacroix" not real company name)
- If repreneur interested → signs specific NDA → gets full teaser
- **Challenge:** "I struggle to see how this could be different" (getting M&A firms to use platform vs. email)

**Ivan's Recommendation:**
- First priority: Validate M&A firms will use a platform
- If yes: Build marketplace/dashboard (copycat Dealmaker model)
- If no: Keep manual process but improve back-office tools
- **Don't build complex matching if simple dashboard suffices**

**Decision:**
- Postpone matching automation for now
- Focus on CRM to manage current 35+ repreneurs
- Test M&A firm interest in platform submission (validation experiment)
- Re-evaluate matching in 3-6 months based on data

### Topic 4: CRM Back-Office Requirements

**Context:** Bertrand managing 35+ repreneurs, can't scale with current Airtable setup.

**Bertrand's Current Workload:**
- 8 finalists from Campaign #2 to follow up
- 4 Campaign #2 finalists (deep engagement)
- 10 from previous campaign (ongoing)
- 6 very promising (meeting next week)
- 10 candidates met this week (at least 6 will work with Re-New)
- **Total: 30+ repreneurs actively managed**
- Plus: 28 List B/C candidates not yet met
- Plus: 4 applications not yet reviewed
- **Grand total: 35+ active, 35+ potential = 70 people in pipeline**

**What Bertrand Needs to Track:**

**Per Repreneur:**
- Profile data (Lead de Cadrage info)
- Relationship history (meetings, calls, emails)
- Actions taken (intros made: lawyer, accountant, M&A firm, operating partner, etc.)
- Services provided (coaching, deal flow shared, network access)
- Monetization status (free, paying, commission pending)
- Next actions (follow-up cadence, upcoming meetings)

**Per Partner:**
- Type (M&A firm, broker, lender, operating partner)
- Deals provided (teaser history)
- Repreneurs introduced
- Commission agreements
- Relationship health

**Per Offer/Service:**
- Service definition (coaching tier 1, deal flow access, etc.)
- Pricing (€100/month, 1% success fee, etc.)
- Repreneurs enrolled
- Revenue generated

**Amelie's Frustration (showing Airtable):**
> "We have too many columns. These are people we will have to talk with but they were not a priority. This is List B (silver medalists). This is bronze. These are very valuable but didn't enter campaign. These are from campaign we will not select... We cannot keep on working with this tool. This is not okay. The follow-up is a mess."

**Ivan's Pragmatic Push-Back:**

**Challenge 1: Build vs. Buy**
> "I understand this tool is crap for what you need now. My question is: Is having the technology platform connected to making money? One thing is getting repreneurs to sign for support program - you don't need this platform. You take the 4-5 guys, package an offer, sell it to them, see if someone buys. THEN come back and say 'these guys have signed, but we need dashboard to deliver value.'"

**Challenge 2: Prioritization**
> "You say you have 40-50 repreneurs to manage and need CRM. Okay, I understand. But when you say 'monetize in some ways' I challenge you: Test it first before building. Take your top 5-10, make them an offer with pen and paper, see if they open their wallet."

**Challenge 3: Technology Won't Solve Business Model**
> "How are you going to make money? You're just going to get a much better Airtable, and then what? You still have 5 guys you need to take action on. What are your actions? You can experiment your different monetization approaches outside of having perfect CRM."

**Amelie's Response:**
> "You're right. But this is what we stand. We have too many people, we cannot keep on working like this. We need actions with all of them. The follow-up is a mess. We cannot keep on working with this tool. This is not an appropriate tool."

**Bertrand's Frame:**
> "The most important is business-wise: Where do we land in terms of value proposition for different segments of repreneurs? We need to segment and say 'we sell you this, we sell you that, we monetize you like this.' Frame it with general terms, sign people up, and then our back-office is our back-office. What matters is that at the end of the day we are able to deliver and track. If I need to speak every two weeks to this repreneur, I do it and I don't fuck up. I need to do it at scale."

**Consensus:**
- Work in parallel:
  1. **Business Model:** Design offers, test pricing with 5-10 repreneurs (no tech needed)
  2. **Back-Office:** Implement CRM to manage delivery at scale (Airtable CRM test first)
- CRM is enabler, not solution to monetization problem
- Validate willingness to pay before over-investing in technology

### Topic 5: Interview Recordings & AI Analysis

**Ivan's Proposal:**
> "The meetings you're having with repreneurs is too much of a waste not having them recorded. Or if you have them recorded, I would love to have the transcript. With recent technologies I could really extract so many hidden layers and make them available at scale. That's a gold mine if you're not leveraging."

**Bertrand's Response:**
> "All recorded. I have them in Notion. I have the transcript of the interviews."

**Opportunity:**
- Bertrand conducts consultative interviews with all repreneurs
- Campaign #2: Repreneurs challenge Re-New, reveal gaps in value prop
- Transcripts contain: Pain points, objections, desired services, pricing sensitivity
- **Ivan:** Could use AI to extract patterns, design offers based on actual feedback
- **Amelie:** Need to guide Ivan on what's interesting to extract (requires framework first)

**Action:**
- Design "offer framework" first (what services, what segments)
- Then Ivan can analyze transcripts for validation/refinement
- Example: If offering €100/month coaching, search transcripts for price mentions, coaching needs

## 📝 Key Quotes & Insights

**Amelie on Campaign Learning:**
> "We are not dealing with candidates actually, because we do not provide any kind of job opportunities. We are dealing with repreneurs. These repreneurs can be either products that we may sell to a partner or customers."

**Bertrand on Lead de Cadrage:**
> "Without this doc, it means you've not started thinking really about your project. You've not started to structure it. This is the magical key."

**Ivan on Validation:**
> "I understand the frustration of Airtable now, but I don't see any money coming from my work at the end of the journey. You're just going to get a much better Airtable. Then what? You still have five candidates you have to take action on. What are your actions?"

**Ivan on Platform Strategy:**
> "If you go through the burden of collecting all the data needed to make 120 offers, then just make a dashboard. Just make a copycat of what Dealmaker has. The matching is the easiest part. The value is collecting and structuring the fragmented analog M&A data."

**Amelie on Monetization Urgency:**
> "We cannot make everything free for the candidate and partner at some point. Bertrand has spent an enormous quantity of hours. This should be monetized. The return on investment will be way too long."

**Bertrand on Scale Challenge:**
> "I've got 8 to follow up, plus 4 finalists, plus 10 from previous campaign, plus 6 very promising, plus 10 from this week... it's already 30 something. And I'm not counting the 28 List B and C. There are 35 candidates we can potentially work with and monetize, and 35 we need to meet. I need to do this at scale."

**Ivan's Reality Check:**
> "Take the 5-10 guys that you think will pay. Go yourself. If someone buys, then come back to me and say 'Ivan, these guys have signed, but we need to build a dashboard for them to get value.' Then I jump on that. But first, see if they open their wallet."

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### Re-New is Pivoting (Again)

**From:** Recruitment campaign selecting candidates for ETA opportunities
**To:** Relationship management platform for repreneurs at all stages

**Why this matters:**
- Different metrics (not "candidates placed" but "repreneurs served" + "revenue generated")
- Different tools (CRM not ATS)
- Different value prop (not "get selected" but "get support/deals/network")
- Different business model (multi-sided: repreneur fees + partner commissions + operating partner revenue)

### The Profiling Capability is the Core Asset

**Ivan's observation:**
> "Profiling the candidates, even if you don't have the campaign anymore, profiling should and will stay very much one of your strengths. One of your value as a company is to have strong profiling capabilities."

**Lead de Cadrage = Strategic Moat:**
- Structured data on repreneur readiness, preferences, capacity
- Enables matching, service design, quality filtering
- Competitors don't have this (fragmented, unstructured market)
- Tech platform can amplify this advantage

### Bertrand is the Bottleneck

**Current state:**
- 35+ active repreneurs, 35+ to meet
- All interviews, coaching, intros done by Bertrand
- Not sustainable (founder doing all operational work)

**Solutions needed:**
1. **CRM:** Systematize tracking and follow-up
2. **Offers:** Productize services (not everything custom)
3. **Automation:** Matching, scheduling, email sequences
4. **Team:** Hire or delegate (Amelie, Nacho, others to take load)

### Technology as Enabler, Not Solution

**Ivan's consistent message:**
- Validate business model first (will people pay?)
- Then build tech to scale what works
- Don't build marketplace if M&A firms won't use it
- Don't build CRM dashboards if repreneurs won't pay for services

**Amelie/Bertrand's push:**
- Can't validate at scale without better tools
- Current chaos prevents testing offers properly
- CRM needed to deliver on promises already made

**Resolution:**
- Parallel tracks: Quick validation experiments (5-10 repreneurs, manual) + CRM implementation (Airtable test)
