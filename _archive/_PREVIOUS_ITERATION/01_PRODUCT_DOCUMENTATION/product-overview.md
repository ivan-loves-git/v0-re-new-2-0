## Executive Summary

**Renew Dashboard** is a subscription-based SaaS platform serving acquisition entrepreneurs ("repreneurs") throughout their complete journey: from assessing readiness, through finding and acquiring an SME business, to post-acquisition operations and eventual exit.

**The Business Model Shift:**
- **From:** Traditional accelerator model (candidates as products to sell to partners)
- **To:** Platform subscription model (candidates as customers we serve directly)

**Market Opportunity:**
- 700,000 SME successions needed in France by 2032
- 60,000/year generational handovers in Italy
- **No platform systematically addresses the full acquisition entrepreneur journey**

**Current Stage:** Pre-launch MVP definition. Cohort 1.0 validated demand (60 candidates, 300+ deal pipeline in <1 year).

**Revenue Model:** Subscription tiers (€99-349/month) + Operating Partner retainer (€1,500-3,000/month post-acquisition)

## The Problem

### The European SME Succession Crisis

**Scale of the Problem:**
- **France:** ~700,000 SMEs will change hands by 2032
  - Represents 2.5M jobs and €1.5T in value
  - Many owners (55+) have no succession plan
- **Italy:** ~60,000 generational handovers per year
  - Similar demographic challenge

**Current Gaps in the Market:**

1. **No Systematic Buyer Preparation**
   - Aspiring acquirers don't know if they're ready
   - No structured path to becoming acquisition-ready
   - Self-education is fragmented and overwhelming

2. **Fragmented Deal Flow Access**
   - Brokers serve sellers, not buyers
   - Deal flow requires extensive networking
   - Information asymmetry favors sellers

3. **Complex Acquisition Process**
   - Due diligence is intimidating
   - Financing options unclear
   - Negotiation without guidance
   - High failure rate for first-time acquirers

4. **Post-Acquisition Abandonment**
   - **Highest risk period, zero systematic support**
   - New owners struggle with operations
   - No peer community for guidance
   - Common mistakes are repeated generation after generation

5. **No Exit Planning**
   - Owners don't plan for exit from Day 1
   - Value creation opportunities missed
   - Eventual sale is reactive, not strategic

**Existing "Solutions" Are Inadequate:**

| Solution | What's Missing |
|----------|----------------|
| **Traditional M&A Advisors** | Too expensive for SMEs, transaction-focused only, no buyer preparation |
| **Business Brokers** | Serve sellers not buyers, no vetting, no post-close support |
| **Deal Marketplaces** (BizBuySell, etc.) | No preparation, variable quality, US-focused, transactional |
| **Search Fund Model** | Elite MBA-centric, requires investors, <200 searches/year in EU |
| **DIY/Self-Education** | Fragmented, no accountability, high failure rate |

**The Result:** Thousands of qualified entrepreneurs never pursue acquisition, and many who do fail in the first 2 years post-close.
