## Pricing Rationale

### Why These Price Points?

**Starter (€99/month):**
- **Affordability:** Low barrier to entry for explorers
- **Commitment:** High enough to signal seriousness (not free-trial window shoppers)
- **Comparable:** Similar to Netflix (€13), Spotify (€10), gym membership (€50)
- **Justification:** Structured learning, personalized assessments, community access = €99 is a steal

**Professional (€249/month):**
- **Value Alignment:** Acquisition = €1-5M deal. €249/month is 0.002% of deal value.
- **ROI:** If platform helps close deal 3 months faster, saves €750/month opportunity cost.
- **Comparable:** Business coaching (€500-1,000/session), search fund membership (€2,000+/year)
- **Justification:** Curated deal flow + expert guidance + coaching = easily worth €249

**Enterprise (€349/month):**
- **Value Alignment:** Business EBITDA = €200K-500K. €349/month is 0.8% of EBITDA.
- **ROI:** If platform prevents one major mistake (e.g., customer churn), saves €50K+ easily.
- **Comparable:** Business advisor retainer (€1,000-3,000/month), fractional COO (€5,000+/month)
- **Justification:** Operating support + KPI tracking + peer community = massive value for €349

**Operating Partner (€1,500-3,000/month):**
- **Value Alignment:** Dedicated advisor for €1,500-3,000 vs. fractional executive (€5,000-10,000/month)
- **ROI:** If advisor increases EBITDA by 10% (€20-50K/year), pays for itself in 1-2 months.
- **Comparable:** Fractional COO (€5,000+), business coach (€1,000+/session), consultants (€10,000+/project)
- **Justification:** Unlimited coaching access = unbeatable value for first-time owners

---

### Price Sensitivity Analysis

**Willingness to Pay (Survey Results - Campaign #2):**
- Starter: 70% would pay €99/month for discovery tools
- Professional: 60% would pay €249/month for deal flow access
- Enterprise: 80% would pay €349/month for post-acquisition support
- Operating Partner: 40% would pay €2,000/month for dedicated advisor

**Price Elasticity:**
- Starter: Relatively elastic (price-sensitive explorers, could lower to €79 if needed)
- Professional: Inelastic (searchers need deal flow, willing to pay)
- Enterprise: Highly inelastic (owners desperate for support, would pay more)
- Operating Partner: Inelastic (high-value, qualified segment)

## Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Acquisition Platforms)

| Platform | Price | Target | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **SearchFunder** | $100/month | Search fund entrepreneurs | Deal flow, network | US-focused, no education |
| **Axial** | $1,000+/month | Institutional buyers | High-quality deals | Expensive, not for first-timers |
| **BizBuySell** | $50/month | DIY buyers | Large inventory | Low quality, no support |
| **Renew Dashboard** | €99-349/month + OP | Repreneurs (full lifecycle) | Education + deal flow + coaching | New entrant, building inventory |

**Positioning:** Renew is the only platform offering **full lifecycle support** (Discovery → Exit) with **coaching and community**, not just deal flow.

---

### Indirect Competitors (Coaching, Education)

| Service | Price | What You Get | Renew Advantage |
|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **MBA Programs** | €50,000-100,000 | General business education | 1/100th the cost, acquisition-specific |
| **Business Coaches** | €500-1,000/session | Ad-hoc guidance | Structured platform + coaching + community |
| **Search Fund Accelerators** | €10,000-20,000/year | Network, some coaching | Broader audience, no investor requirement |
| **M&A Advisors** | 5-10% of deal value | Transaction support only | Full journey support, not just deal |
