# DEC-20241020: Weekly Team Meeting Cadence & Structure

**Date:** 2024-10-20
**Deciders:** Alex, Ivan, Piera, Gabriele, Nacho (full team consensus)
**Status:** ✅ Decided & Implemented

---

## 🎯 Decision

Re-New 2.0 team will hold **weekly sync meetings every Monday from 7:00-8:00 PM** during October 2024. Starting November 2024, the cadence will shift to **bi-weekly** due to team travel commitments (seminars, conferences, Paris events).

**Meeting Structure:**
- Duration: 45 minutes max (not full hour)
- 10-15 minutes: ICP/academic deliverables discussion
- 30 minutes: Round-table workstream updates (Scale & Refine, Monetization, Expansion)
- Ad-hoc: Strategic discussions as needed

**Flexibility:** Team members can skip occasional meetings without concern, but must review meeting notes and honor decisions made in their absence.

---

## 🤔 Context

### Problem Statement

After the Re-New 1.0 to 2.0 team transition, the new team lacked a regular meeting cadence. Not all members could attend the July handoff meetings, creating knowledge gaps. The team needed to establish a consistent sync schedule to maintain alignment, track ICP progress, and make collective decisions.

### Background

- Re-New 2.0 team formed in late summer/early fall 2024
- Team members have varying schedules (courses, work travel, international seminars)
- ICP (academic deliverable) has timeline pressure
- Team is geographically distributed or has conflicting commitments
- Previous meetings were ad-hoc, leading to misalignment

### Constraints

- **Schedule conflicts:** Different members have different availability
- **November travel:** Multiple team members attending Global Horizon seminar (Paris), Madrid electives, international conferences
- **Course commitments:** Strategy & Project Management course (Oct 21-22), various ongoing courses
- **Bertrand availability:** Founder has limited time; team should sync internally before involving him

## 🔍 Options Considered

### Option A: Weekly Meetings (Entire ICP Duration)

**Description:** Hold weekly sync meetings every week from October through ICP completion (estimated Q2 2025).

**Pros:**
- Tighter coordination and faster decision-making
- Easier to catch issues early
- More face-time builds team cohesion
- Frequent check-ins on ICP progress

**Cons:**
- High time commitment (weekly for 6+ months)
- Difficult to maintain in November/December (travel season)
- May feel excessive once team hits stride
- Risk of meetings becoming "check-the-box" vs. valuable

**Estimated Effort:** High (52+ meetings over ICP duration)
**Risk Level:** Low coordination risk, Medium burnout risk

### Option B: Bi-Weekly Meetings (Entire ICP Duration)

**Description:** Hold sync meetings every two weeks from October through ICP completion.

**Pros:**
- More sustainable long-term commitment
- Forces team to be self-directed between meetings
- Leaves more time for actual work
- Easier to maintain through travel season

**Cons:**
- Slower decision-making (wait up to 2 weeks for team input)
- If someone misses a meeting, it's been a month since they synced
- Currently team is behind and needs tighter coordination
- Harder to build momentum early on

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (26 meetings over ICP duration)
**Risk Level:** Medium (could lose momentum, especially early)

### Option C (CHOSEN): Adaptive Cadence - Weekly in October, Bi-weekly Starting November

**Description:** Start with weekly meetings in October (building phase) to establish team rhythm, make critical decisions, and align on ICP approach. Shift to bi-weekly in November when travel commitments increase and team has established working rhythm.

**Pros:**
- Intensive coordination when team needs it most (October - setup phase)
- Adapts to reality of November travel season
- By November, team will have rhythm and can go longer between syncs
- Respects that team is currently behind and needs to catch up
- Demonstrates agile thinking (adapt to circumstances)

**Cons:**
- Transition might feel awkward (need to communicate clearly)
- Different expectations month-to-month
- Requires discipline in November (bi-weekly means each meeting is more critical)

**Estimated Effort:** Medium-High early, Medium later (est. 35 meetings over ICP duration)
**Risk Level:** Low (addresses current needs, adapts to future constraints)

## 💡 Rationale

### Why We Chose This Option

**Primary reason:** Team is currently behind on ICP and needs intensive coordination in October to establish foundations (scope, roles, processes). November's travel schedule naturally forces bi-weekly anyway, and by then team will have established rhythm.

### Key Factors

1. **Current State:** Team acknowledged they are behind. As Alex noted, "we need to keep on starting" and October is the time to build momentum. Weekly meetings accelerate this.

2. **November Travel Season:** Multiple non-negotiable commitments:
   - Last week of November: Paris seminar (Global Horizon) + Re-New event + workshop
   - First week of November: International seminar (multiple team members)
   - Madrid electives (Nacho mentioned ongoing commitments)
   - This makes weekly meetings impractical in November anyway

3. **Ivan's Flexibility Argument:** "If we do it weekly, it could be more flexible. If I'm busy or Bertrand is busy, I can skip without too much concern... With bi-weekly, it becomes once a month if you miss one, and we don't have many months ahead of us."

4. **Nacho's Bandwidth Argument:** "Right now in October I have more bandwidth. Later in November with the seminar, Global Horizon, Paris and so on, it will be more constrained. I prefer to push October to get things stabilized so we can fly more independently in November."

5. **Shorter Duration for Weekly:** Because meetings are weekly in October, they can be 45 minutes instead of full hour. Less overhead per meeting, more agility.

### Meeting Time Selection (Monday 7-8 PM)

**Process:** Google survey sent to team showing availability across the week.

**Results:**
- Monday 6-7 PM or 7-8 PM: 3-4 people available
- Tuesday 6-8 PM: Similar availability
- Wednesday 6-7 PM: 3 people available
- Thursday-Friday: Poor availability
- Weekends: Varied, generally not preferred

**Choice:** Monday 7-8 PM
- Good availability across team
- Beginning of week (sets tone for the week)
- Late enough that people can handle work/class commitments first
- 7-8 PM specifically chosen over 6-7 PM (exact reason not captured, but consensus)

### Assumptions

- Team will respect meeting time and attend unless conflicts
- Those who miss will review meeting notes and honor team decisions
- By November, team will have established enough rhythm to go bi-weekly
- Travel conflicts in November will affect multiple people (making weekly impractical anyway)
- ICP deliverable timeline allows for this cadence

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Weekly meetings feel like overhead/busywork | Low-Medium | Medium | Keep to 45 min max; skip if truly nothing to discuss; focus on value (decisions, unblocking) |
| Transition to bi-weekly in November is forgotten/mishandled | Low | Low | Calendar invites will reflect change; remind team in late October |
| Someone misses multiple meetings, falls out of sync | Medium | Medium | Mandatory meeting notes review; honor decisions made in absence; consider Loom/async updates |
| Monday 7 PM doesn't work for everyone long-term | Low | Medium | Re-evaluate in November; survey did show this was best time for most |
| Bi-weekly in November is too slow when issues arise | Medium | Low | Use Slack/Notion/async for urgent items; can always call ad-hoc meeting |

### Note on Founder Meeting Cadence

Separate decision made about meeting with Bertrand and founders:
- **Bertrand + founders:** Once per month

## 📝 Notes & Updates

### Initial Reflection (2024-10-20)

**Meeting Structure Decisions:**
- 45 minutes max (not full hour) because it's weekly
- 10-15 min dedicated to ICP (academic deliverable is core priority)
- 30 min for workstream round-table (keep everyone aligned)
- Ad-hoc time for strategic discussions (like expansion pivot today)

**Flexibility Culture:**
Ivan: "If I'm busy, I could skip without too much concern and catch up on materials. With my calendar being very variable and dynamic, this is better."

**Commitment Culture:**
Team agreed: If you skip a meeting, you follow up with what people agreed upon. Decisions made in your absence still apply.

**November Context:**
- Last week of November: Paris (Global Horizon seminar + Re-New event/workshop)
- First week of November: International seminar (multiple attendees)
- By mid-November, team will have only 2-3 available weeks → bi-weekly makes sense
