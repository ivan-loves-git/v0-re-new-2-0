# DEC-20241101: Dual Monetization Strategy - Test Both Sides Simultaneously

**Date:** Early November 2024
**Deciders:** Amelie, Bertrand, with Ivan advisory input
**Status:** 🔄 Decided - Testing in Progress (3-6 month experiment)

---

## 🎯 Decision

Re-New will **simultaneously test two monetization streams** for 3-6 months:

1. **Stream 1 (Partner-side):** Sell vetted repreneurs to M&A partners (commission model)
2. **Stream 2 (Repreneur-side):** Sell services to repreneurs (coaching, deal flow access, operating partners)

After experimental period, evaluate which stream shows strongest signals and choose primary focus (or continue both if both validate).

**Approach:** Measure willingness to pay on both sides, then decide based on data, not assumptions.

---

## 🤔 Context

### Problem Statement

Re-New has no revenue. Multiple potential monetization paths exist, but unclear which will actually work. Team debate: Should we monetize partners (B2B) or repreneurs (B2C/prosumer), or both?

### Background

**Current State (November 2024):**
- Zero revenue generated to date
- Campaign #2 completed, 35+ repreneurs actively engaged
- Partner relationships established (M&A firms sending deal flow)
- Multiple service offerings conceptualized but not priced/sold
- Urgency to validate business model and generate cash

**Stream 1 Context (Partner Monetization):**
- **Model:** M&A firms pay Re-New commission for introducing vetted repreneurs who close deals
- **Example:** €3M acquisition → M&A firm earns €300K (10%) → Re-New gets €25K (~1%)
- **Current status:** Conceptual, no formal agreements or revenue yet
- **Amelie's concern:** "Maximum 20 partners per year... this is not long-term enough monetization. Return on investment will be way too long."

**Stream 2 Context (Repreneur Monetization):**
- **Model:** Repreneurs pay Re-New for services across multiple layers
  - **Layer 1:** Coaching, deal flow access, network (€100/month example pricing)
  - **Layer 2:** Operating partner support post-acquisition
  - **Layer 3:** Investment vehicle access
- **Current status:** All services currently free (Bertrand investing hours unpaid)
- **Amelie's argument:** "Bertrand has spent enormous quantity of hours following candidates, guiding them, sending opportunities, matching. This should be monetized."

**Strategic Tension:**
- **Ivan's platform logic:** Keep repreneurs free if that maximizes partner-side value
- **Amelie/Bertrand's cashflow need:** Can't sustain free services indefinitely, need revenue
- **Risk:** Monetizing both sides could cannibalize (repreneurs won't pay if partners already paying Re-New for them, or vice versa)

### Constraints

- **Cash urgency:** Re-New needs revenue soon to sustain operations
- **Time:** 3-6 months to test before running out of runway
- **Data scarcity:** No historical data on willingness to pay from either side
- **Scalability:** Partner commission model caps at ~20 deals/year (Amelie's estimate)

---

## 🔍 Options Considered

### Option A: Focus Only on Partner-Side Monetization

**Description:** Sell vetted repreneurs to M&A firms/brokers. Keep all services free for repreneurs to maximize volume and quality.

**Pros:**
- Clean platform logic (one side pays, other side gets value for free)
- Easier sales (partners understand commission model)
- Repreneurs attract more easily (no barrier to entry)
- Proven model (recruiters, brokers operate this way)

**Cons:**
- **Amelie's objection:** "Maximum 20 partners per year, not long-term enough"
- Revenue capped by partner deal volume
- Long sales cycles (deal closings take months)
- Uncertain partner willingness to pay (no validated pricing yet)

**Estimated Revenue (Year 1):** €200-500K (if 10-20 deals @ €25K each)
**Risk Level:** Medium (depends on deal flow volume)

### Option B: Focus Only on Repreneur-Side Monetization

**Description:** Charge repreneurs for coaching, deal flow access, network, post-acquisition support. Partners get free access to repreneur pool (incentive to send deal flow).

**Pros:**
- Recurring revenue potential (monthly subscriptions)
- Shorter sales cycles (repreneurs pay for service, not tied to deal closure)
- Scalable (serve hundreds of repreneurs vs. limited partner deals)
- Addresses Bertrand's time investment ("his hours should be monetized")

**Cons:**
- Barrier to entry (repreneurs may not pay if market alternatives exist)
- Unproven willingness to pay (no pricing validation yet)
- Risk: Repreneurs expect free services (early-stage entrepreneurs often cash-poor)
- **Ivan's concern:** May reduce repreneur volume/quality, hurting partner value prop

**Estimated Revenue (Year 1):** €120-360K (if 30 repreneurs @ €100/month avg, or 10 @ €1K/month)
**Risk Level:** High (willingness to pay unknown)

### Option C (CHOSEN): Test Both Simultaneously

**Description:** Run dual experiments for 3-6 months:
- Offer partner commission model to 5-10 M&A firms
- Offer repreneur service packages to 5-10 repreneurs
- Measure: Conversion rates, revenue, customer satisfaction, operational burden
- Decide after experimental period which to prioritize

**Pros:**
- Learns fastest (tests both hypotheses in parallel)
- Preserves optionality (can pivot based on data, not guesses)
- May discover both work (diversified revenue streams)
- Reduces risk of choosing wrong path prematurely

**Cons:**
- Team capacity (Amelie/Bertrand testing two models simultaneously)
- **Ivan's warning:** "One will cannibalize the other unless made very strategically"
- Risk of confusing market (inconsistent positioning)
- May succeed at neither if focus is split

**Estimated Revenue (Year 1):** €50-200K (experimental phase, low volume)
**Risk Level:** Medium (split focus, but de-risked by learning)

## 💡 Rationale

### Why We Chose Dual Testing (Option C)

**Primary reason:** Insufficient data to choose between partner-side or repreneur-side monetization. Testing both is fastest path to validated learning.

### Key Factors

1. **Data Scarcity:** No one knows if partners or repreneurs will actually pay
   - Partner commissions: Conceptual, no pricing validated
   - Repreneur services: All free to date, no willingness-to-pay signals
   - **Can't decide without data**

2. **Urgency to Validate:** Re-New needs revenue and validated business model
   - Can't afford 6 months testing partners, then 6 months testing repreneurs (too slow)
   - Parallel testing accelerates learning

3. **Ivan's Pragmatic Framework:** "Try both, measure, then choose"
   - **Ivan:** "If you want to increase revenue, don't always look at asking more people. Sometimes keeping one side free brings more value on the other side. Test both, but frame it as an experiment with time limit."
   - Explicitly frame as experiment (not permanent strategy)
   - Set decision point: 3-6 months, then evaluate

4. **Amelie's Cash Flow Imperative:** Can't sustain free services indefinitely
   - **Amelie:** "We cannot make everything free for candidate and partner at some point. Return on investment will be way too long."
   - Need to start generating revenue from somewhere

5. **Different Scalability Profiles:**
   - Partner model: Limited volume (20/year) but larger ticket (€25K)
   - Repreneur model: High volume potential (100s) but smaller ticket (€100-1K/month)
   - Testing both reveals which actually scales in practice

6. **Mitigate Cannibalization Risk:**
   - Segment offers carefully (partners pay for vetted intros, repreneurs pay for coaching/services)
   - Different value props reduce direct cannibalization
   - Monitor for signs of conflict (partners refusing to pay if repreneurs paying, or vice versa)

### Ivan's Warning & How We Address It

**Ivan's concern:**
> "At some point you should probably choose where to focus your effort. One is going to cannibalize the other unless made very strategically."

**How we mitigate:**
- **Time-boxed experiment:** 3-6 months, then decide (not permanent dual model)
- **Clear decision criteria:** Measure conversion rate, revenue, customer sat. Choose winner or continue both only if both validate
- **Strategic segmentation:** Different services for partners vs. repreneurs (reduce cannibalization)
- **Willingness to pivot:** If one shows clear traction and other doesn't, kill the loser

### Assumptions

- Both sides may pay (not mutually exclusive)
- 3-6 months sufficient to get meaningful signals
- Team can handle testing two models without burning out
- Market won't be confused by dual positioning (B2B and B2C simultaneously)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Both fail (neither will pay) | Medium | Critical | Pivot to different model; 3-6 months allows time to course-correct |
| Cannibalization (one kills the other) | Medium | Medium | Monitor closely; if detected, kill weaker model immediately |
| Split focus leads to failure at both | Medium | High | Limit scope: 5-10 tests per side (not 50); tight time box |
| Team burnout (testing two models) | Low | Medium | Bertrand already doing both activities; just formalizing |
| Market confusion (unclear positioning) | Low | Low | Internal experiment; can clarify positioning after choosing winner |

## 📝 Notes & Updates

### The Pricing Examples (Not Final)

**Partner Commission:**
- €3M acquisition → M&A firm earns €300K → Re-New gets €25K (~1% of deal)
- This is illustrative; actual pricing TBD based on partner negotiations

**Repreneur Services:**
- €100/month for 2-month coaching package (€200 total)
- This is starting point; Bertrand will test and iterate

**Both are hypotheses to be validated, not fixed prices.**

### Ivan's "Platform Strategy" Insight

**Ivan's framework:**
> "Platform strategy: Keep candidates free if that brings more value on partner side. Don't try to squeeze money from everyone. Sometimes keeping one side free makes you more money on the other side."

**Example:** Uber keeps riders free (charges drivers). Airbnb keeps guests mostly free (charges hosts).

**Re-New consideration:** If keeping repreneurs free → more/better repreneurs → partners pay more → total revenue higher than charging both sides

**Counterpoint (Amelie):** Bertrand's time is expensive. If repreneurs don't pay, are we undervaluing our service?

**Test will reveal answer.**

### Segmentation is Key to Avoiding Cannibalization

**What partners pay for:** Vetted, trained, finance-ready repreneurs (saves them sourcing time)

**What repreneurs pay for:** Coaching, deal flow access, network, post-acquisition support (accelerates their journey)

**Different value props reduce risk of cannibalization.** If both are valuable, both may pay.
