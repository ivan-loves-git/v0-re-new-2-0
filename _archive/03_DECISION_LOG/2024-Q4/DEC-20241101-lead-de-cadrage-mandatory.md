# DEC-20241101: Lead de Cadrage as Mandatory Entry Requirement

**Date:** Early November 2024
**Deciders:** Bertrand, Amelie (operational policy)
**Status:** ✅ Decided & Enforced

---

## 🎯 Decision

**No repreneur can enter the Re-New ecosystem without completing a Lead de Cadrage.** This structured profile document is the "magical key" (Bertrand) that gates access to all Re-New services: deal flow, coaching, partner introductions, investment vehicle, etc.

**Operational rule:** Lead de Cadrage is mandatory, non-negotiable entry requirement.

---

## 🤔 Context

### Problem Statement

Re-New was receiving applications from people at vastly different stages of readiness:
- Some just exploring the idea ("super early")
- Some committed but unstructured ("quite early")
- Some ready to evaluate deals ("advanced")
- Some in active negotiations ("super advanced")

Without structured profiling, Re-New couldn't:
- Match repreneurs to appropriate deals
- Design appropriate services per stage
- Filter out tire-kickers from serious repreneurs
- Scale Bertrand's time efficiently

### What is Lead de Cadrage?

**Structured document profiling the repreneur's acquisition project:**

**Sections:**
1. **Who is the person?** (background, skills, experience)
2. **What acquisition project?** (sector, region, timeline)
3. **Professional background** (expertise, network)
4. **Target company characteristics** (size, metrics, industry)
5. **Purchase price range** (deal size they're targeting)
6. **Financing capacity** (how much capital can they bring?)
7. **Acquisition structure** (majority vs. minority stake, partnership models)

**Current Format:** PDF document (repreneur fills out, submits)
**Future Format:** Web form → structured database (enables automation)

---

## 💡 Rationale

### Bertrand's Framing:

> "Without this doc, it means you've not started thinking really about your project. You've not started to structure it. This is the magical key. Without Lead de Cadrage, we cannot match with opportunities, we cannot bring deal flow, which is the core value we aim at creating."

### Strategic Value of Lead de Cadrage

**1. Quality Filter:**
- Completing Lead de Cadrage requires thought and effort
- Separates serious repreneurs from casual explorers
- If someone won't invest 1-2 hours to structure their project → not ready for Re-New

**2. Matching Enabler:**
- Structured data = matchable data
- Can't pair repreneur to deal without knowing: sector preference, region, financing capacity, deal size
- Lead de Cadrage provides all inputs needed for matching algorithm

**3. Service Design Input:**
- Early-stage repreneurs (vague Lead de Cadrage) need coaching
- Advanced repreneurs (detailed Lead de Cadrage) need deal flow
- Document content reveals what service tier to offer

**4. Conversation Accelerator:**
- Bertrand's interviews more productive when Lead de Cadrage pre-read
- Can skip basic questions, go straight to value discussion
- Repreneur has already self-reflected, conversation is consultative not exploratory

**5. Scalability Requirement:**
- Bertrand can't spend 2 hours with every applicant to gather basics
- Lead de Cadrage front-loads the work on repreneur
- Bertrand's time focused on high-value advisory, not data collection

**6. Strategic Moat:**
- Competitors don't have structured profiling of repreneur universe
- Re-New's Lead de Cadrage database = unique asset
- Enables services competitors can't provide (precision matching, staged coaching)

## 📊 Impact

### Who This Affects

**Repreneurs:**
- Must complete Lead de Cadrage to access Re-New
- Barrier to entry (1-2 hours of work)
- But also value: Forces them to structure thinking

**Re-New Operations:**
- All repreneurs in CRM have structured profile data
- Enables segmentation, matching, service design
- Reduces Bertrand's screening burden

**Partners:**

## ✅ Implementation

### Current State (November 2024)

- Lead de Cadrage is PDF template
- Repreneurs fill out, email to Re-New
- **Enforcement:** Bertrand doesn't meet anyone without completed Lead de Cadrage

### Future Enhancement (Planned)

- **Web form:** Convert PDF → interactive web form
- **Database:** Store responses in structured format (CRM or database)
- **AI parsing:** If still PDF, use AI to extract structured data
- **Automation:** Lead de Cadrage data feeds matching algorithm

### Integration with CRM

- Lead de Cadrage data = repreneur profile in CRM
- Fields map directly: Sector preference, region, deal size, financing, etc.
- Updates to Lead de Cadrage update CRM record

## 📝 Notes

### "The Magical Key" (Bertrand's Term)

Bertrand's framing elevated Lead de Cadrage from "nice to have" to "core strategic asset."

Without it: Re-New is just another networking group
With it: Re-New is precision matching platform with proprietary data

### Conversion Funnel Consideration

**Potential Drop-off:**
- Some applicants may quit when asked to complete Lead de Cadrage
- This is feature, not bug (filters out unserious)

**Monitoring:**
- Track: Of 100 applicants, how many complete Lead de Cadrage?
- If <20%: Form may be too onerous, simplify
- If >80%: May not be filtering enough, add depth

**Current hypothesis:** 40-60% completion is healthy (serious repreneurs stay, tire-kickers leave)
