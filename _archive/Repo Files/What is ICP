Purpose & context Ivan is the Digital Director leading the Scale-up workstream for Re-New 2.0, an EMBA Individual Consulting Project (ICP) focused on transforming manual candidate selection processes into automated platforms. The project operates in the "repreneurship" space and is structured as an academic consulting engagement with team-based coordination and regular tutor oversight from Professor Kupp. The team is organized into three workstreams: Scale & Refine (led by Ivan and Nacho, focusing on website and automation technology), Monetization (led by Alex, developing operating partner services), and Expansion (led by Piera and Gabriele, exploring growth opportunities). Key stakeholders include team leader Bertrand and board member Pierre Laurent, who has raised critical questions about expansion strategy and revenue projections. Success involves both delivering a functional automated platform and navigating the academic evaluation process, where strategic thinking and business model validation are as important as technical execution. Current state Ivan has successfully delivered a website relaunch and built an AI-powered screening platform using no-code tools like Flatchr during Re-New 1.0. The platform focuses on reducing cost per candidate screening and providing time-tracking for interview processes. However, Campaign #2 revealed a critical insight: the team faces a distribution problem rather than a technology problem, despite having automation infrastructure in place. The team is grappling with fundamental business model validation challenges rather than pure scaling, as highlighted by advisor feedback questioning their expansion approach. They've standardized on Notion for collaboration and maintain weekly meeting schedules with regular tutor check-ins. Key learnings & principles A major realization emerged from comparing Campaign #1 (which generated 60 candidates with zero marketing effort) to Campaign #2 (which didn't achieve expected candidate volumes despite automation infrastructure). This revealed the classic "product-market fit vs. product optimization" tension that technical co-founders face. The team has learned to distinguish between having impressive technology and having effective distribution - a critical insight that's reshaping their strategic priorities and resource allocation decisions. Approach & patterns Ivan approaches strategic challenges by developing structured option frameworks rather than presenting complaints about task assignments. He works to reframe technical decisions as business strategy questions, particularly around timing and resource allocation. The team maintains regular coordination through weekly meetings, uses Notion for collaboration, and engages actively with academic oversight to ensure both project success and favorable ICP evaluation. Ivan balances technical execution with strategic positioning, being mindful of how different approaches (deep AI work vs. growth engineering vs. platform building) might be perceived in the academic evaluation context.

ICP

It combines an academic/research component (for the framework, the theoretical concepts, the
methodology, data collection, etc…) and a strong professional approach (as it is a real-case
activities at executive-level).
ICP topics are based on executive level issues, for ex.:
● Creation of a comprehensive business plan for a new activity (including ALL its
parts, from market analysis to financials),
● Reorganisation plan for a distribution network,
● Company rebranding and repositioning,
● Market or product diversification,
● Launch of a new product / entering into a new market, etc…
1. Objective
The ICP is a team project. It combines an academic/research component (for the framework, the theoretical concepts, the methodology, data collection, etc…) and a professional approach (as it is a real-case activities at executive-level).

2. To put into practice the concepts and theory acquired during the Executive MBA with the support and guidance of an ESCP faculty member.
2. Outline
 In groups, participants are expected to perform an in-depth analysis of a situation, or a problemfaced by a real company and to define recommendations for actions that can realistically beimplemented by the business.
This 12-month team project allows participants to use and consolidate their understanding of the concepts and tools taught during the programme. The outcome of the ICP is a comprehensive report, which includes a series of recommendations at executive level that the sponsor company(corporate/institutional or entrepreneurial/start-up) can implement in order to meet the strategic challenge at hand.
The final report is defended in front of an academic jury. The presentation is made publicly orprivately according to the level of confidentiality required by the company sponsor.After the presentation/defense in front of the jury on the ICP day, each participant has to preparean individual academic paper, based on the results/data/findings of the ICP project.
