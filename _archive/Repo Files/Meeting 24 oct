Amelie
What's up? Hi Fabio, hi Thomas, Angel 

Bertrand
Hey there What's up? Ciao Hello You trimmed your beard Did I? 

Amelie
pretty uh a bit uh you play you play a lot with your beard with everything so we're we're we're still waiting for nature i thought let me whatsapp him to check if he stills plan to come or 

Bertrand
see we have yeah interesting call because many things to discuss uh based on what we learned from the campaign and uh yeah there are lots of learnings things we need to digest and sleep over things that we can start to action now what a teasing so 

Ivan Paudice
so yeah great to hear great to hear really look forward for some update we missed the last uh the last call last week and so it's been a while i really i'm really curious to know how how things have developed and on my side i've been hyper busy developing some recent technologies that have been released into into some potential ideas that could also impact on you uh along you know a little bit down along the road so for now i'll be listening but i think in a few weeks you you will be listening from my side as well. Some proposals. 

Amelie
- Okay. Can we give you the new briefing before? - Yeah, yeah. - Because we, to avoid the, but I don't know. So we were supposed to meet with Nacho about 30 minutes ago and we have no news. What do we do, Bertrand? We start with an event to make the world wrap up. Okay. 

Ivan Paudice
- Let's start with Ivan. 

Amelie
- So, well, yeah, and then you will have, will see how we end over with natural but so the the major outcome of the of the campaign uh is and let's say that it's quite of an interesting uh uh learning no but in the end let's let's try to make it long story short but in the end we are not dealing with candidates actually because we do not provide any kind of you know like a job opportunities etc we are dealing with repreneur and these repreneurs can be either products that we may sell to a partner or searching for profiles so it's one one thing but they will have to be and they are also um customers because in the end we will need to have them as customer of our different services so campaign of recruitment is only a cool marketing tool that we could keep a little bit you know that once or twice a year mostly in terms of marketing on linkedin just to um you know like make a little bit of buzz like a recurrent meeting but uh um it it's not the the future of renew okay we are not selecting repreneur we are identifying and proposing solutions to our corner uh so uh which even 

Ivan Paudice
I think to use a little bit of self-esteem, like this is something we were also kind of drafting at a very early stage. We said always that the campaign could have been marketing and I say could and not will be because we needed winners, we needed to promote the success. So I think it's not a big surprise. 

Amelie
No, it's not a big surprise, you're right. yet it gave us a lot of insights that we could not have uh without i mean it was an interesting tool to start with because thanks to that we managed to uh uh first confirm many of the hypotheses that we had uh at the beginning and everything has been kind of confirmed like you know the market the need etc it raised a lot of other you know like question and will require a lot of work on our side to clarify plenty of things one second qu'est-ce qu'il y a chaton but uh okay um but long story short uh this this we will we will keep it on a light mode okay so everything that we did previously like you know like the scoring the matching the resumes etc in the end we don't give a it's not very interesting i mean it works to have a quick idea of what was the candidate but the most important is what they said from day one the lead the cadrage the document that gives us all the insights of where the the entrepreneur stands on his entrepreneurship journey etc um and so the next big move and that's why we wanted to have the 

Bertrand
call with you and natural today is uh ats yeah sorry go ahead and the form because structured data is essential because uh let the cadrage is unstructured it's a pdf that ai struggles to read and parts and so the form where we collect info and we can ask also more questions in the form like where are you looking for like Auvergne in the France or not so this to have this embedded so we have all this structured data so at some point we can do the matching easily with the teasers but 

Ivan Paudice
yeah i mean profiling the candidates is even if you don't have any more the campaign profiling should and i think will stay very much one of your strengths one of your value as a company is to have a strong profiling capabilities so it could be a fault and and by any mean i okay but i want 

Amelie
to amelie to finish her story no no no this is our story i was talking about the i mean the plan because here i could make a small digression on the fact that i think the meetings that you are 

Ivan Paudice
having with the with the entrepreneurs is too much of a waste not having them recorded because or if you have them recorded i would love to have the the transcript because i'm sure with with recent technologies i could really really extract so many hidden layers and and make them available at scale at any search so i think that's a gold mine basically if you are not 

Amelie
you're not yet uh leveraging so for no you're right you're right you're right but for you to to get the diamonds from the interviews we need you to to to guide you on uh what what in the end is interesting because many many i mean we need to frame a little bit more um okay let me share with you if we compare the interviews we had last year with the interviews we had this year it's totally different okay last year was real hr quite boring interviews versus this year um for example for the past six seven candidates we have been challenged by the candidates okay so they challenge us we are we're moving a conversation rather than you know like diving on okay what have you done what are your strengths what is your core expertise well more on a discussion with someone who is into the the process of takeover a company and and they challenge us on what we could provide them with so it's very interesting it's the and it by the way enlighten us on all you know like the missing part of um of our um what we could propose not missing part but the parts were not clear enough so long story short you're right we could we could use a lot of information from these interviews and those exchanges i totally agree and we we should and we could by the way that's all i regard all of 

Ivan Paudice
them by design okay that's good because you can keep them and we will find a use later there is no need to think about that now as long as you have them i'm happy i have them in notion it's recorded 

Bertrand
and i have the transcript of the interviews super okay so the outcome uh where we landed uh with 

Amelie
bertrand in the next past past few days is ats is dead crm is the future what is the future sorry crm crm okay yeah because we ats is useless like it's okay to gather some applicants but in the end that's not what we want to do so we need a crm to give the crm where we have offers that we we need to design and this is the big next step for us to design what what our offers are what we use so let's rename candidates because they are not candidates anymore but let's call them okay so yeah because it really is misleading i think so we have the recorder okay repreneur can be either a product or can be a client okay um we have the partner all the partners that we will work with and are currently working with that are client customers and we have offers that are products that we may say may sell to the repreneur repreneur customers okay so repreneur 

Ivan Paudice
can be customer or product what is the second one product or project what are you seeing products what do you mean what would be a product customer just to understand so 

Bertrand
there what what we imply here is that i mean for the moment the customer is our product and the reprunner is our product because the client is the partner okay who's paying at the c'est le partenaire, comme la boutique M&A qui fait le deal avec le reprenneur. Elle nous donne une commission sur le business généré. Donc, qui paye ici? C'est le partenaire. Donc, le reprenneur, dans ce cas, est un produit. 

Ivan Paudice
Je suis le suit et je vous ai suivi dans ce sujet, mais pourquoi il peut être deux choses? Parce que le reprenneur peut te payer quelque chose pour les services? 

Bertrand
yeah because of a partner we consider also that at some point so we need to determine when and when we will place the cuts but what we do maybe this is something that we still need to be discussed they still need to discuss among the founders and align on is do we ask also a fee a success fee to the uh repreneur just to illustrate uh and to give you some flavors on the magnitude of numbers entrepreneur and finance if it makes a three million euro acquisition it will take more or less 10 percent of this okay yeah on that deal so they get 10 of the value what they will give us is 25k so more or less one percent okay so we take one person so they do more things than we do they do the due diligence etc but we consider maybe that one person is not enough and we could also ask like one person to the to the candidate as well at some point for the moment we still i mean it's like uh it's like uh uber at the beginning it was dirt cheap so we sponsor with our time the candidate but to have a critical mass but when we have the critical mass and we already have deals that have been accomplished then we can say something we say hey candidates you will give us 

Ivan Paudice
one percent yeah i i will not mix the two things just in in shortly i think here is purely platform strategy and i think right now you don't i wouldn't mix the two things which are one how much money do we get for the value that we produce and the other one well we produce platform don't produce auto value platform have strategic dominance so how much are we paid for what we have in terms of candidates etc and and the other one is should the candidate pay the two things wouldn't be i I wouldn't try to mix them because you could very much keep developing your platform strategy Preserving the candidates so keeping the door open for them because slow If that's ultimately bringing you more value on the other side of the chain, so the monetization strategy If you want to increase more money, don't always look at about but asking to more people because sometimes the candidates could be Better in a long time for you to keep the door open You could think about asking a little bit of a fee in terms of credibility, where we discussed last time, should we build a platform for 50 euro per month or whatever, so that they can start circulating in our ecosystem, we can start looking at them. But it's a big investment in terms of technology. And then you are competing with someone that is already existing, which is also good things. You can steal a lot of things and be faster. But yeah, so I would say look at a candidate payment more in that sense, As long as you think that the candidate is your product, that you can sell, the more product, the better. Ask just a little bit more to the other guys rather than... 

Amelie
Yes, but to be honest with you, our monetization system and profitability at some point, I mean, we need to come back on what we said. And we cannot make everything free for the candidate for partner at some point. And that's why we need to build some offers that could be... Because, for example, right now, of course, we are working for free. Mais Bertrand a dépensé une énorme quantité de heures en suivant les candidats, les conduire, les envoie des opportunités, les matchs, etc. Et ça, à un moment donné, devrait être monetisé. La façon dont nous travaillons avec les candidats, c'est de donner des conseils, etc. Il devrait être monetisé. C'est une autre chose. C'est que nous avons trouvé notre stratégie. 

Ivan Paudice
we want to try both broad both roads and see which one of the two is producing is producing something 

Amelie
and then at one point we have to choose i think we can do two i know i think we can do both um that's why i was saying that the repreneur is both a product that we may say to some partners that will be okay yeah not all the partners some partners and that was the base of our monetization model some partners are interested in getting vetted candidates that have been screened and followed by renew and would be okay to pay for it but this is the maximum will be 20 per year like in the in the good years okay so uh this is not a long long term and enough way of monetization okay but second on what we provide to the candidate for product we provide selection access to the flow personal uh um network network that we provide them with this is the first the first thing that for now is free okay the second thing we provide is the operating partner proposition that will be when they will finalize the deal with or without us you can provide them with operative partners during one year two years to help them securing the success of their takeover of the company okay and third is the investment vehicle that we are working on so we have three layers and at least the first one and the second one we should be monetized like we should get money from this because otherwise this is this is just working for free and the return on investment 

Ivan Paudice
will be way too long do you follow me i follow i follow you absolutely i just yeah it's clear my advice and lots of advice is about fresh eyes bringing your fresh perspective by any means you know then take it and do whatever you want with that i think it's super okay to say we are experimenting on both streams so for a moment three months six months we will try to sell something to the candidates while we try to sell some candidates to the partner we will try both ways and see which one of these two is uh you know it's uh is adding a grip is added some Because you can very well make a selling proposition why the partners should pay you and you can make a very nice proposition why the customers, the candidates should pay you. At the end is who is willing to open the wallet and do that. Understood that the partners are too long, too little money, too uncertainty. So this is not sustainable and we need cash to make the business goal. And I fully understand that you want to explore the other one. My only thing is that at one point, I think one is going to cannibalize the other, unless made very strategically well. So at one point, you should probably choose where to focus your effort, where to ask Ivan or your next intern to work rather than. But this is thinking ahead. I think it's super okay. And I'm just saying, I suggest to frame it like this, saying we have, this stream is providing some uncertainty and may kill the business because we don't have enough time to wait for that to to develop and so we are trying this and try by any way if you know that is a trying that means you have a time frame that means you will try to sell and then you measure are they willing to pay yes not should we make more service 

Amelie
should we lower the price you're right but for this we need the data and we need the information that we actually kind of gathered through the second campaign like really i don't know about with how many people you told me but so that was the reason why we wanted natural to join up so here is the idea right now is that we want to do the math slash the stats of the second campaign that is about to be uh achieved okay so we stopped you know gathering candidates so we have the all the all the applications we have a very very clear listing on uh who was outed immediately after application thanks to the scoring and by the way we need to do a little bit of post-mortem of of this corinne okay we have the list of who is a superstar who entered the process who entered the process uh so we we started to frame that so natural we will ask him to work on the analytics of this part okay and i think that through the notes and you're right through the the feedback the interview recording for all the people that bertrand worked with we could start to frame uh for extra this is this kind of uh offer what i call offer right now is a next step so with uh paul we we talk with him is not in the campaign he will not be the winner for x y reason but paul we is a great guy and we can help him and support him on this this and this and this is where we we need to frame our offer because the candidate at some point could become a customer for this offer. That he will, or not pay him by the way, but it's clarifying what is the next step for this specific kind of candidates or reprenner. You see what I mean? And so for this, we don't need an ATS. We need a CRM. And we would like to work on the analytics to create the backbone of the CRM through Fletcher with all the weaknesses of Fletcher and design the appropriate CRM for a renewed need. And one of the things we identified that could be automatized, and we would like your advice and probably your help on this, is the automatization between the lead de cadrage and the opportunities that Bertrand gathered through our partners on deal flow. Bertrand has different opportunities, it's a huge deal flow from plenty of different sources, and we would need something to help us on making the match between the L'Ede de Cadrage of Paul, Clémence and Louis and the deal flow. 

Ivan Paudice
L'Ede de Cadrage is in English? 

Bertrand
Je vais partager mon écran pour que vous puissiez voir ce qu'il y a. 

Ivan Paudice
Vous ne pouvez pas translate le cadre. Je veux dire, c'est un candidat pool ou quoi? Non, c'est un entrepreneur. 

Bertrand
Je vais vous montrer. Il se ressemble à ça. Vous pouvez voir mon écran? C'est un document où vous avez qui est la personne, quel projet de acquisition. Je cherche une nouvelle compagnie, etc. blah what's your training uh what's your professional background your skills what the target company is looking like in terms of sector what are the regions uh what are the main characteristics what what are the metrics okay okay what is the purchase price how much money i can we bring and uh do i want to acquire the majority or blah blah blah so the structure of 

Ivan Paudice
the project so this is a little carriage that's a candidate profile so i'm matching between the 

Amelie
candidate profile and the repreneur profile not candidates because it's for reprener it no i know i know it costs me so much to pronounce this word in terms of effort let's go with candidate i know no no let's remove candidates we need to brainwash no right the reason why i i use the letter to specify that it's not candidates because it's very very very specific to repreneurs. A resume is specific to a candidate but let the cadrage should be the magic path for all repreneurs. And by the way, we kind of designed and defined this that no repreneur could enter any kind of free your fuse or system or process or whatever without the cadrage. 

Bertrand
This is the magical key. Without this doc, it means that you've not started thinking really about your project. You've not started to structure it. Yeah, I mean, as long as we have enough candidates, 

Ivan Paudice
because you can ask, and you know the story here, but... oversold up like you can invest money in simplified lead the profile of the entrepreneur the schema to be built so you can help them making that you can ask them no i will we will only accept you if you have already made it and made it well you you can you can do many things depends how much offer you where do you want to let's say meet the the offer sounds in midway how much do you need them to be already motivated how many of them are already motivated or if you want 

Bertrand
to kind of pull the candidates a little bit out but that's yeah the thing is uh the the way i see things um already people who have led the cadrage they are different buckets of people and they are different type of let's say service that we can provide to them but without that without this no matching we cannot match with the opportunities we cannot bring the deal flow which is a value we aim at creating and which is the core value because we aim at being contacted by intermediaries and mna firms with opportunità di investimento per passare a loro in un pool di operazioni. Quindi se non abbiamo questo, non può succedere. Ma se abbiamo potenti operazioni che ci contattano e non abbiamo questo, possiamo impostare le coaching. Ok, ok. 

Ivan Paudice
Let me try to be as valuable as possible, making another question. Why are you trying to... So, okay, I understood. Matchmaking. So, create some technology that can match the candidate profile, not candidate, the repreneur profile with the sum of the deals that you have. Because likely you will have a relation between one to many, I guess. Pourquoi voulez-vous faire ce match et ne pas avoir les candidats de la décision de la décision? 

Amelie
Parce que c'est exactement notre proposition de valeur! 

Ivan Paudice
Parce que... C'est une bonne proposition de valeur si c'est une tare très compliquée si il y a tellement de offres, tellement de compagnies et tellement de candidats ou si les affaires sont des propriétés IP restriquées pour que personne ne veut les mettre dans une liste publique 

Speaker 4
parce qu'ils peuvent être copiétés très vite. Ces deux raisons pour laquelle je dirais que vous êtes... 

Ivan Paudice
Et je peux comprendre que vous êtes en deuxième cas parce que vous n'avez pas de affaires de vous-même, vous les avez pris de vos partenaires. 

Bertrand
Mais les partenaires sont vraiment un niche, très petite boutique, super analogique, not present on linkedin with a website that is a vitrine website you know just showing we are 

Ivan Paudice
small okay so you think your value is about this your value could be putting this granular analogic dispersed data value in a structured way this is what you are trying to tell me yeah yeah because 

Bertrand
as a entrepreneur you know imagine you have one thousand people in france this very day who are doing exactly the same stupid job of trying to identify which corporate bank should i contact i will send my letter that they will not read okay because they have other things to do when you ask them they say yeah let the garage from individual repreneur we don't even check but what we do we say yeah but we vet those candidates for you we ensure that they are finance enough and good enough to go for the opportunities you have so when there is an opportunity that they have and that match with our pool we connect but also imagine i'm looking to acquire a company close to lyon in fact the intermediaries and corporate banks having those mandates for companies around lyon they are scattered over France. You can have a guy, a small M&A firm in Lille, who is having this opportunity. But if I live close to Lyon, I only know the intermediaries around. And you have guys in Paris having these deals in Lyon, but I don't know them. So it's really complex for individual entrepreneurs, the 1,000 people I was mentioning, to contact each and every intermediaries in France. 

Ivan Paudice
This looks very much like the house market here. You're saying before the platforms arrived, if someone has to sell a home, nobody knew what home was sold. 

Speaker 4
So why this is not existing today? 

Ivan Paudice
Why today we have Immobiliare.it in Italia? where the customer will be the M&A boutique that is interested in the first place, not to give shitty analogic data to Ivan that makes technology things, he will be super interested to have a portal to load his data. Then the problem there is that contrary to home, you don't want this data to be public. So here you are playing a little bit of the game where you are the gatekeeper of this information. So you give this to us and we will only provide to qualified candidates in a specific way. 

Bertrand
Yeah. I mean, it's one big assumption to think a portal could be the solution because you need to picture how it works today. If there is a teaser that's been sent to me and that I find interesting for a candidate, We say yeah before we go any further you have to you need to have this candidate selling a specific NDA for this specific teaser so that so it's not sure because it's something they don't share easily you know I understand the company 

Ivan Paudice
doesn't want to know that they are in sales like this would be solved already if this was solvable it would be already dissolved so it's so much of a plain sight problem that i think there is a good reason for so at my understanding right now there is kind of this way where there is a small someone that holds 150 deals that with phone calls etc i got the sign to know but then they will not give it to you uh if not anonymized and then you should call them and get this data out so what i'm trying to say i'm trying to you know give you some perspective but also how do you want this dashboard to be built like then my question right here on the on the notepad is the matching okay that for me means understanding the data structure of the revenue profile and the data structure of the deals what is your data structure of the deals and how many sources of data do you have and how much how are these available to you like in which form in which entity of data like maybe someone only gives you the value doesn't give you the name someone gives the name and doesn't give you location so what are your source of data do you think you will keep having them for a long time do you need help to structure these different sources do you have 

Bertrand
100 sources 10 sources what's your plan here uh yeah i mean i mean those are good questions i mean for the moment it's uh i am contacting reaching out to those nmna firms saying yeah i'm reviewing send me your teasers sometimes they say yeah interesting sometimes they say no and then they send by email pdf file so this is how it happens and i struggle to see how different it could be uh then once they give you like me and they give you the pdf file 

Ivan Paudice
with the whole information they trust you on the whole thing and they tell you don't don't spread it around or they tell you you can spread it around you make us a favor no i can't spread 

Bertrand
it around i've signed let's say uh an umbrella nda okay for me as a company to say yeah i won't up with your ip right so i'm a trustable guy my goal is to provide you candidates so i can watch the stuff and if i think it's interesting for someone in my cool then they sign an nda that i give you and they can access okay 

Ivan Paudice
No, no, but what does it mean being convinced? I'm just thinking here, it's where is the business spark? Like again, technologically everything is feasible. So I can imagine, very much depends from the numbers. I think we need to spend a little bit more time understanding the landscape to give you some stronger recommendation. understanding if you have how many deals are you aiming to have and how many partners are holding 

Amelie
this deal? No, no, but that's why we need to work on the data. I mean, the purpose of today, well, missing that show, was to merge the end, you know, of the campaign as ATS resumes, no, no, no, to get the appropriate data to analyze properly what's the pool, okay? So how many people, the level of qualification because in the end the major outcome is that a next candidate that is now a entrepreneur has value for us depending on where we stand on the project okay so early super early quite early super advanced and and based on that we can provide some um offers and monetization okay so that that's the first thing now we merge the campaign hr process which we are kind of killing now with the next big move which is okay how we deal with that in terms of monetization and if you say that technologically speaking everything is feasible that's exactly what we wanted to hear so 

Ivan Paudice
thank you good news that's what i tell to my client all the time is then it's the second part of the sentence that is it depends on the benefits that you want to it's all about cost benefit here what i'm seeing here tell me more about that this can be replicated this could be something doable what's 

Bertrand
here yeah let me explain so deal maker is a partner yeah i remember this we discussed this 

Ivan Paudice
last time he you pay a subscription to get to this list right yeah you pay a subscription so 

Bertrand
if i want to see that i need to pay like 250 yeah and these deals are not deals that are placed you know by the seller directly you're not the business owner it's all intermediated deal so if i look at this one okay i know so this company and you see the level of info is very light so i can't guess who's the company says please uh okay this one is a if you want to contact the person sign the nda so it generates the end so for every space for every 

Ivan Paudice
specific console all these companies are anonymized to me for sure because it's in french but i guess also for a French speaker they are anonymized so it's all okay and you click so once you're 

Bertrand
signing in here you click and I mean hello I would like to know that you are so because I mean at 

Ivan Paudice
At this stage you could also ask for the repreneur profile, like the little French things, you know? Because at this stage if you want to have contact with that company we need for you to provide this. And for you would be kind of a good way to intercept profiles where you can resell services in a sneaky way. I'm using this word but not in an evil sense. Like you can gather the data and understand where you have opportunities to resell. Just say if you want to speak with this company, yeah, you sign the NDA, but you also provide this information, a little interactive form, so that I can ensure that you are worth the call. Let's put it this way. And that dashboard, like that could be replicated within the scope of an ICP. I can try, but it's more about then who is managing. Like, do you think you could maintain that? Like that amount of deals, I don't know where they come from. Do you have that amount of deals? 

Bertrand
So let's be clear. Yeah, we need to frame where we want to go. What we aspire is that all those companies, you know, that work with dealmakers, you know, they identify us as a player and send us also their teaser. Okay. Like we determine, we say our candidates are fit to acquire between 3 and 10 million. This is what we are working on. This is our sweet spot. So if you have something like that all over France, all type of business, you send to us. And yeah, and we do the vetting, the matching, and we connect them with the candidates. following the let me just see because the key concept i think here is 

Ivan Paudice
uh how can i frame it like once you go through the burden of collecting all the data needed to make this 120 offer that iphone dealmaker i don't know if the number was the number of offer they had yeah okay at that point the matchmaking isn't that i'm not sure there is that much value in creating a matchmaking unless you tell me even if you make the matchmaking you give me the important edge to go to someone and tell them that i will not put them on a board and i can provide just the deal to the specific candidate but i don't think there is so much value in that because when I see that the dashboard you show me everything is anonymized already so I think once you must collect all the data and I give you a way to structure it into at that point just make a compare just make a copycat of what dealmaker has and give the candidates the chance to screen the things by themselves I can make the matching I can make recommendations it's the easiest part but for you the value of having the dashboard to present to someone maybe ask them to pay which I'm sure is a is more uh the payment for for deal maker is uh isn't really moving the needle of their business it's more a way for positioning the dashboard in the mindset of the people right right so yeah this is what i'm saying like if you are thinking to move away from uh being able to provide get money from bringing up the so many good candidates that people would buy from you and sustain the business and now you want to move into gathering the the deals and provide the deals to the candidates uh to facilitate them the accruciation i think but at that point you may have some money or i think you can build the dashboard if you have all the data needed for the matchmaking tell you tell me why not to be the dashboard yeah this is what is called the teaser i should not 

Bertrand
Je ne vais pas vous montrer parce que vous n'avez pas signé l'NDA C'est plus non structuré avec des analyses Ok, structure, etc Et donc qui est en charge de la... Il n'y a toujours pas de compagnie ici? Pardon? Il est encore anonymisé? Oui, il est anonymisé parce que le nom est projet... Donc Lacroix n'est pas le nom de la compagnie okay okay okay so you've got some info some analysis so yeah this is what is uh okay yeah 

Ivan Paudice
so i told you you do tell me why should that be a matchmaking and not i'm putting you to you something new on the table i'm telling you that the vr complexity is to get the data organized from the candidates i think it's relatively easy few of them you can ask them to fill information from the deals is about reaching the information so you need to be able to know where to look for it and be authorized to access it so you know the scenario there i'm telling you if this is fragmented if everyone is out is afraid of spreading things and you have done all this layer of anonymized summary plus anonymized pdf and then maybe one day you know the name if this is true then you will go through so much burden to collect all the data for the matchmaking that i think then the matchmaking itself for 120 deals it's 120 they can scroll it in in 50 minutes uh it's uh it's not that much of a value unless you tell me that people will throw deals at you if you can ensure them that you will not put them on a dashboard but i don't see that this dashboard is so anonymized that i don't see 

Bertrand
yeah yeah what what i could do is maybe have a shared let's let's do it low-key low-tech what the deal that will interest me i will put them in a google sheet like this is the region this is the revenue this is the media this is the industry and i mean the candidates they can check this the entrepreneur they can check this google sheet so all the entrepreneurs who are working with and they reach out to me and say yeah that i'm interested in this this and that and i make the 

Ivan Paudice
intro to the candidates to me to the candidates because isn't the main problem getting the deals sorry don't you think it's more complicated to get the deals 

Amelie
Ivan is not secured on how you get the deals. I think it's not clear for Ivan on how you, Bertrand, get the deals. Because on what you're explaining right now is that you are the go-to person, the only person that is gathering the information regarding the deal. So this is what is missing to

Ivan actually. And my understanding is that the deals are super, are managed like, you know, high estate homes like where you don't want things to go around so collecting them at scale it's coming so i thinking loudly the first thing i would do is to fake it until you make it go to your deals say guys we are building a platform this is the link we think the platform will benefit you for x y and z click on this link and give me your 10 years see how many of them are interested i don't know if you have 100 contacts or you have 10 of them you want to shake hands um can you rewind the wrong because i did not understand you too fast i know i know sorry guys i meant i think the first step more than the candidates which i think as long as you provide them deals the more deals you provide the more you will be appealing it's just about asking the right amount of money for the list i would i would try to validate and verify first that once you got you you you have a way to collect the deals the deal maker would be willing to give them to you so i was suggesting as a first step to fake it or at least to put things a little bit in a way where you write an email if you have 100 contact or you make a phone call if you have 10 contacts where you say we are building this platform we are now we know we have a lot of candidates we fake it that we have a lot of candidates we have a we want to build a place where your deal anonymized can be evaluated so that we will help you finding the right match in no time etc can you press this button make an action can you press this button and give me the data for your deals if they tell you no and make you 100 problems then you understand that building the dashboard is 100 effort if they jump on it two out of ten you've got something you've got only customers and and then uh 

Amelie
i don't know if it makes sense yeah it really makes sense yeah can i just jump in again we are losing a little bit ourselves on this because we are focusing too much on one little part of the general topic so what you're explaining right now is very interesting and it's a very good point but it's one of the x offers that we could propose because the matching thing is one of the x offer first things first i think the next big move is for us to have a proper place where we have all the person we're talking with candidate entrepreneur partner and on our side that but to exist in this tool which should be a crm which is what are the offers and where do we stand with the offers right now our main point blocking point is we have candidates slash reprida and we don't know what to do with them immediately okay it's because the tool we have 

Ivan Paudice
is not working what are the offers that you have in mind outside of a matchmaking so it's coaching 

Amelie
it's sending uh the the sending uh accurate deal flow for the candidates it's put the candidate in relation with x y z partner which is their time day-to-day work by the way so all the people we work with after each of the interviews or exchange he has an action to do okay so put them in contact with this lawyer put them in contact with uh uh put them in contact with prosperity so and this culture that does not make the job okay so so for me this is the first step and it will really really help us on better realizing um what we call offers what are the next step and where we could make money and value then the the automized uh deal flow matching is a complex topic you're right so it's either we become the leader and the number one in making a gathering all the different opportunities in france and make it accurate for everyone perhaps it's a bit too high end for us today but it's worth having a look at it but i think that in between having somewhere where we know exactly what are the steps what we do with women in terms of what we propose and how we can monetized after what could be a b plus am i right or wrong bettel i wanted to go a bit higher because we went quite deep in a very specific approach which is a brand new model which which could be a great one but do we want to become the matching platform yes no maybe perhaps we need a bit more time to decide on this and you're right even you're you're raising a lot of flags or needs that we need a serious uh for now i would say at least you know gather all the 

Ivan Paudice
information in the appropriate place okay uh taking out the matching part which was your desire and every beside one maybe was you know immediately transformed in a priority but uh putting that side i think we deep dive there also because i i i felt there was a clear selling point and go on the other ones that you you mentioned i heard you speaking about matching people making him shaking hands with making him meet that lawyer uh get the deal flow which to me looks a little bit like the matching uh so outside of the deal flow i heard from you a lot of relationship things which i don't really understand how do you like you can track them and probably some of the many crm system i don't know or air table or whatever notion can work the point and with the interest of you know what do you think to you will get out of it outside of having a nice place where you can say okay now i see all the relationship history with this guy now i can think about how can i get money from him if i understood you want to have a place where you can kind of have your cockpit you want to have a place where you can go and see how much time have we invested in this guy and i don't know really with which connection how you make money out of it because i don't see this connected if bertrand present the guy 200 people and he still doesn't close a deal what are you going to ask the guy what kind of offer are you thinking what kind of offer are you thinking about rather than 

Amelie
So that's it. This is where we stand. We need now to design the offer, which is, okay, you start to discuss with us, and we think that there is something to do, and this is the first offer that we can propose, which is a personalized coaching, accompagnement, and Bertrand and the Renew team, Bertrand and some other people around, will make sure that you speak with the YZ, and it could be like, I don't know, like only, I don't know, 100 euros for two months, just to be put. in touch with someone. We need to monetize this. We need to define these offers to make sure that these actions are generating some revenue. And so this is what I call an offer. An offer could be first layer of coaching. Like you speak with us, you enter in the renew or ecury, you know, like what's the word in English for ecury? I don't know. Table? You know, like in the, who cares? and then if you sign up a deal with this or this partner that we put you in contact with we have X percent of the deal so this is another I understand in 

Ivan Paudice
this case I challenge you why do you need the technology for because we are not going to do that on a Google sheet no but you can identify your top two three potential the people that you have in mind that will be willing to pay what is hundred euros per month and you go there and offer them say look we are putting together this kind of service the sun is going to be full-time committed to this are you willing to open your wallet because this is always the magic gate where people go from I'm interested in you - sorry I'm very thank you but not thank you are you open to willing to open the wallet and get this hundred per month you can go on the first few samples you can use your grease elbow 

Amelie
you can just you know wait this time come up the second campaign and that's why so now this is what we stand so you have you can see my screen right yeah okay so we cannot keep on working like this it is not okay okay so we have too many columns so these are the people we will have to talk with but they were not a priority This is the list B, so it's like the silver medalist of the applicant. This is the bronze medalist of the applicant. These are those that are very, very valuable but didn't enter the campaign. These are the campaign. And these are from the campaign that we will not select until the end, but we need to do this. We need actions with all of them. And my point is that we cannot keep on working with this tool. This is not okay. This is not an appropriate tool because we don't know what to do. The follow-up is a sheet. okay okay so this is what i couldn't share right now but let me let me be let me be brutal here 

Ivan Paudice
emily and i do this because i know so well how important is to focus the effort on things that bring you the most value which is often knowledge for the startups i understand this tool is crap it's it's for what you need now i understand it my question is you are you came to me with a very clear proposition we need to make money because i think we can sell offers to some of the guys that we have highlighted i jump i'm just challenging the fact that the the thing is having the the technology platform is connected to this because one thing you say to get the candidates signed for some kind of uh support program you don't need this platform you take the four or five guys that made we need actions you spend half an hour a bit with a you take a sheet of paper and you say this guy we try to we package one offer we sell it to all of them we make personalized we decide you go yourself if someone buys then you come back to me and say even these guys have to sign for it but they i think we need to build a dashboard for them we need to build something that is providing them the value of this subscription outside because it's not professional it's not giving enough value the fact that you know what emailing so you're right but then i jump on that but then if you and then let me finish you can also say we don't need this and i just need something better the fletcher to manage the guys but then i tell you how are you going to make money so i understand the frustration of fletcher now but i don't see any money coming from my work at the end of the journey you're just going to get a much better with that table you can do that in two days of work much better flow and then what you have always the five candidates you have to take action on what are your actions so you know you have five guys you want you can 

Amelie
experiment your different monetization problem outside okay 10 15. yeah it's more than 40 50 indians so the idea was to have something if you said that with the table we can do that in today's 

Bertrand
that's fine we have at you as a crm i have an account uh we can see i mean it's from the shelf i need to see how it works anyone we're experimenting i think the most important is business wise where do we land in terms of value proposition for the different segment of candidates that we have so we need to segment and say we sell you this we sell you that or we monetize you like this okay frame it with general term sign and and then our back office is our back office but what matters is that at the end of the day we are able to deliver and track that if I need to speak every two weeks to this candidate so if I need to do this or this or that I do it and I don't fuck up but because i need to do it at scale because at the end of at the end of the campaign so here we've got eight to follow up already plus the fourth finalist so it's 12 plus the 10 from the previous campaign so it's 22 plus six that are very promising that we meet next week so it's 28 and i have met like 10 candidates this week and at least six we're going to work with them so it's already it's already uh 30 something and i'm not counting the 28 list b and c that i have not met that i need and the four i have not reviewed the application so there are 35 candidates that we can potentially work with and monetize in a way and 35 candidates that we need to meet okay i mean this 

Ivan Paudice
This is a bit of a different proposition when you say I'm a solopreneur, I'm buried under the amount of inputs and activities I need a CRM to put myself in the capability to deliver value. Okay, this I understand. When you say monetize in some ways I would still challenge to try to test it a bit before but we can work in parallel so i'm okay if i'm okay i mean i i understand where where the crm value could could come uh if it's frames this way we could find different different scenarios to to make this uh this setup made and by any guys you know when and girls when i try to challenge with the i mean i understand that sometimes it looks like i want to just obstaculate or or to to challenge every kind of evaluation but trust me i do that with the only you know only scope to to to be brutal but make reality checks on things because otherwise uh it could be much easier just to jump on any idea and then wait two to three weeks before we take your uh we take your challenges 

Amelie
the uh first super positively and second uh uh it also uh puts you like the finger on one specific thing is that we come with a kind of requirements etc without taking prior to that the right amount of time to debrief you and where we stand and that's also the problem on the because you're quite advanced already you know like under the peak but i mean as you said you haven't speak with bertrand for the past two weeks you didn't have any contact with so you are not on boarded at the same pace as as we are so i understand that's why you asked so many questions and we should have had updated you a bit more uh into details uh for right now but okay so you get it we actually we need a back office tool that will that will support us and help us making sure that we are on the right you know like and by the way it will also help us a lot to have vision on on pre-monetization of the different steps uh because we are going to work a lot on offers that's the major next move for us so what are we what we are going to propose and how we will monetize etc but this uh this back office thing will help us and then when it comes to the platform yes we need to work a little bit more on this i'm so sorry guys i need to go the the girls are jumping around 

Bertrand
i promised to go and buy it and i have 50 partners in five minutes for the operating okay so so so 

Amelie
what do we say to it so no news from that show so i think he will come back apologizing you may have so let's try to to catch up with natural uh because even if i'm not wrong you're all going 

Ivan Paudice
towards um yeah the original seminar end of next week meet me next week wednesday i'm taking my flight for for for south africa and as well um yeah so that is great you'll be together no i don't think that nashaw will do the same but for for singapore or oria i don't remember but i know he will not be in south africa piera will be in south africa which i haven't yet seen her once in a meeting for more than 10 minutes and it was in two meetings only it's so it will be a time 

Amelie
for for me to speak with her about about the do not hesitate to uh on border a little bit on the project answer our question no so i'm not sure i'm not sure there will be a possibility for a meeting uh in the next 10 days 

Ivan Paudice
no i don't know how much this can let's let's i mean you are in a hurry i don't want to hold you further i think we need five ten minutes more probably to to now decide next step next action if we need to talk with naso and also understand that building us here around for me i would do that for for supporting you guys it's not something that is technically challenging or strategically uh interesting but i would be more than happy to do something that that would put you in a good shape uh so maybe the money i can get back here is to try to do something with ai that that will uh will uh will uh will work also in my case and for the icp project in some way but let's uh 

Bertrand
let's have a follow-up maybe the ask and we need to clarify the next one the ask is not about building a crm because they are on the chef applications that exist like atio and others so yeah we need to be clear and land on what we want to achieve with candidates so our value proposal and so what we need to deliver to them and then ask ourselves the question how we can achieve it so here it was just i mean setting the scene of yeah always been through the learnings and uh yeah maybe the crm is not bived it's buying and so we take a subscription for atio and boom and maybe it's on the matching that we need something or not but 

Ivan Paudice
yeah i think the platform is interesting there are there is a lot of interesting points with the meetings i think we discussed many things let's uh make the the thoughts a little bit settled i i'm i hope i brought you also some some points of reflection and so maybe on monday we can have 

Amelie
follow-up for an hour we can you know and on my side I update next show mostly on the data and statistics of the campaign that will definitely help on designing the next step okay we do that? 

Bertrand
yeah have a great weekend guys bye bye はい。 Okay. おやすみなさい
