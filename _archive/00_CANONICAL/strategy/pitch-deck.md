## The Problem

### The €90 Billion Crisis

**700,000 French SMEs need succession by 2032**

Yet entrepreneurs who want to acquire them face:
- ❌ No structured path from interest to ownership
- ❌ Quality deals hidden behind closed networks
- ❌ Traditional advisors too expensive for €1-10M deals
- ❌ 2-3 years of searching, often ending in failure
- ❌ Isolation and lack of expert guidance

**Result:** 60% of profitable SMEs close instead of transitioning
