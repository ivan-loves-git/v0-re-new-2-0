# The Problem Re-New Solves

## Executive Summary

Thousands of profitable French SMEs face closure or decline because entrepreneurs who want to acquire them lack structured support, while traditional advisory services are inaccessible for deals under €10M. Re-New bridges this gap with a technology-enabled platform that democratizes the acquisition process.

## The Macro Problem: SME Succession Crisis

### The Numbers
- **700,000** SMEs in France need succession by 2032
- **€1-10M** deal size is systematically underserved
- **60%** of SMEs close due to lack of successors
- **€90 billion** of enterprise value at risk

### The Human Cost
- **Jobs Lost**: 2.5 million employees affected
- **Communities Damaged**: Local economies decimated
- **Knowledge Destroyed**: Decades of expertise vanishing
- **Wealth Evaporated**: Family legacies ending

## The Entrepreneur's Problem: Broken Acquisition Journey

### 1. Discovery Blindness
**"I don't know if I'm ready or what I'm looking for"**

Entrepreneurs face:
- No framework to assess acquisition readiness
- Unclear on what type of business to target
- Unable to define investment thesis
- Confusion about capital requirements
- No roadmap for the journey ahead

**Result**: Many qualified buyers never start, or start poorly.

### 2. Deal Flow Darkness
**"I can't find quality opportunities"**

The reality:
- Best deals never hit public marketplaces
- Broker networks are closed to outsiders
- Geographic limitations restrict access
- No systematic search methodology exists
- Months wasted on dead-end pursuits

**Result**: Entrepreneurs spend 2-3 years searching, many give up.

### 3. Evaluation Paralysis
**"I don't know if this is a good deal"**

Critical gaps:
- No framework for due diligence
- Valuation models are complex and opaque
- Risk assessment requires expertise they lack
- Financial modeling beyond their skillset
- Every deal feels like the first deal

**Result**: Good deals passed over, bad deals pursued, costly mistakes made.

### 4. Network Isolation
**"I don't have access to the right people"**

Missing connections:
- Lawyers specializing in SME acquisitions
- Lenders who understand the model
- Accountants for due diligence
- Industry experts for validation
- Peers for advice and support

**Result**: Overpaying for advice, using wrong advisors, or going without.

### 5. Process Complexity
**"I don't know how to actually close a deal"**

The maze includes:
- Legal structuring options
- Financing arrangements
- Negotiation tactics
- Seller psychology
- Transition planning

**Result**: Deals fall apart at the finish line, relationships damaged.

## Why Traditional Solutions Fail

### Traditional M&A Advisors
**Problem**: Minimum fees of €50K-100K+ exclude deals under €10M
- Not economically viable for smaller transactions
- Cookie-cutter approach doesn't fit SME reality
- Focus on financial engineering, not operations
- No support post-transaction

### Online Marketplaces
**Problem**: Just listings, no support
- No curation or quality control
- No guidance through the process
- No access to off-market opportunities
- No help with evaluation or execution

### Business Brokers
**Problem**: Misaligned incentives
- Represent sellers, not buyers
- Motivated by commission, not fit
- Limited to their own listings
- No preparation or education provided

### DIY Approach
**Problem**: Too complex, too risky
- Learning curve measured in years
- Mistakes cost hundreds of thousands
- No access to institutional knowledge
- Isolation leads to poor decisions

---

## The Hidden Costs of the Status Quo

### For Individual Entrepreneurs
- **Time Lost**: 2-3 years of searching vs. 12-18 months with support
- **Money Wasted**: €20-50K on wrong advisors and failed deals
- **Opportunities Missed**: Great deals they never see or can't evaluate
- **Stress Endured**: Uncertainty, isolation, and decision paralysis

### For the Market
- **Inefficiency**: Qualified buyers and good businesses don't connect
- **Value Destruction**: Businesses close that could thrive under new ownership
- **Economic Drag**: Capital sits idle instead of driving growth
- **Innovation Stagnation**: Fresh thinking doesn't reach traditional industries

---

## Why This Problem Persists

### 1. Information Asymmetry
- Insiders control access to deals and knowledge
- First-time buyers systematically disadvantaged
- No central repository of best practices
- Success stories and methods stay private

### 2. Fragmented Ecosystem
- Dozens of stakeholders, no coordination
- Each advisor solves one piece of the puzzle
- No integrated solution for the journey
- Entrepreneurs must orchestrate alone

### 3. Economic Misalignment
- Service providers need large deals to profit
- Small deals can't support traditional fee structures
- Technology investment hasn't reached this market
- Innovation focused on venture, not acquisition

### 4. Cultural Barriers
- Entrepreneurship through acquisition less known in France
- Risk aversion around business ownership
- Limited awareness of the opportunity
- Few visible success stories or role models

---

## The Opportunity in the Problem

### Market Timing
- **Demographic Wave**: Unprecedented number of retiring owners
- **Cultural Shift**: Growing acceptance of acquisition entrepreneurship
- **Technology Ready**: SaaS tools can now deliver at scale
- **Capital Available**: Banks increasingly comfortable with acquisition lending

### Competitive Vacuum
- **No dominant player** in the €1-10M segment
- **No technology-first** solution in France
- **No integrated platform** for the full journey
- **No community-driven** approach

### Network Effects Potential
- Each successful acquisition creates ambassadors
- Partners benefit from aggregated demand
- Data from transactions improves the platform
- Community knowledge compounds over time

---

## Re-New's Problem Definition

**We solve the fundamental disconnection between:**

1. **Qualified entrepreneurs** who want to acquire SMEs but lack structured support, AND

2. **Quality SMEs** that need successors but can't find prepared buyers

**By providing:**
- Technology that democratizes access and knowledge
- Advisory services that fill expertise gaps
- Network connections that open doors
- Community support that reduces isolation
- Proven process that increases success rates

---

## Success Metrics

### For Entrepreneurs
- Time to acquisition drops from 2-3 years to 12-18 months
- Success rate increases from <20% to >50%

### For the Market

### For Re-New
- Platform becomes default choice for acquisition entrepreneurs
