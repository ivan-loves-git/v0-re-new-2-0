# Re-New Value Proposition

## The Problem We Solve

### For Entrepreneurs

**The Acquisition Journey is Broken**

Entrepreneurs who want to buy and operate SMEs face a fragmented, opaque, and inefficient process:

- **Discovery Challenge**: "Am I ready? What should I look for? How do I prepare?"
- **Deal Flow Access**: Quality opportunities are hidden behind broker networks
- **Evaluation Complexity**: Due diligence requires expertise they don't have
- **Network Gaps**: No access to lawyers, financiers, advisors who understand SME acquisitions
- **Process Uncertainty**: Every step is a black box with hidden pitfalls
- **Time Waste**: Months spent on deals that won't close

**Market Reality in France:**
- 700,000 SMEs need succession by 2032
- Deal sizes €1M-10M are underserved by traditional advisors
- Information asymmetry favors insiders over qualified outsiders
- First-time buyers face systematic disadvantages

### The Cost of the Current System

- **For Entrepreneurs**: Missed opportunities, costly mistakes, prolonged searches
- **For SME Owners**: Business closure instead of successful transition
- **For the Economy**: Value destruction, job losses, knowledge disappearance
