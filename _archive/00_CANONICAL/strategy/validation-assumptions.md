# Core Assumptions & Validation Framework

## Purpose of This Document

The assumptions outlined below represent **critical hypotheses that must be validated** before Re-New can confidently scale. They are framed not as criticisms but as pressure tests—thinking like a future investor or operating partner trying to reduce uncertainty.

**Key principle:** These are **validation tasks, not monetization questions**. Our immediate priority is validating that we have a scalable, repeatable market engine. Once confirmed, monetization will follow more naturally and with greater clarity.

---

## Assumption Framework

Each assumption follows this structure:

- **Assumption:** What we believe to be true
- **Risk if false:** What happens if we're wrong
- **Validation approach:** How we test it
- **Success criteria:** What "validated" looks like
- **Status:** Current validation state
- **Owner:** Who's responsible for validation

---

## Critical Assumptions (Tier 1)

### 1. Repeatable Candidate Flow

**Assumption:**
Re-New can attract a continuous stream of qualified entrepreneur candidates beyond the initial wave fueled by founders' personal networks.

**Risk if false:**
Candidate sourcing would remain a one-off event, not a repeatable engine—limiting scalability and future revenue opportunities. Without systematic sourcing, Re-New becomes a consulting practice, not a platform.

**Validation approach:**
1. Analyze Cohort 1 sourcing: origin of candidates, channels used, time/resources invested
2. Map which candidates came from personal networks vs. systematic channels
3. Run Cohort 2 with deliberate emphasis on non-network sourcing
4. Test specific channels (LinkedIn ads, content marketing, partner referrals, events)
5. Measure cost and conversion at each funnel stage

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] >50% of Cohort 2 candidates come from non-founder-network sources
- [ ] At least 3 validated channels with consistent lead flow
- [ ] Predictable cost per lead and lead-to-applicant conversion rate
- [ ] No single channel represents >40% of flow (diversification)

**Current status:** ⚠️ Unvalidated (Cohort 1 was network-driven)

**Owner:** Marketing/Growth lead (TBD) + Founding team

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026 (Cohort 2 launch)

---

### 2. Cost to Produce One Qualified Candidate

**Assumption:**
It is possible to calculate the real resource investment (time + marketing spend + screening effort) required to generate one acquisition-ready candidate—and that cost is economically viable.

**Risk if false:**
Without a clear cost baseline, financial modeling (including pricing and investment needs) would be based on speculation. If cost-per-candidate is too high, the model may be unsustainable regardless of revenue potential.

**Validation approach:**
1. Retrospectively track all Cohort 1 costs:
   - Marketing spend (if any)
   - Time invested (founders + team, converted to hourly cost)
   - Tool/platform costs (Flatchr, assessment tools, etc.)
   - Overhead allocation (legal, admin, etc.)
2. Map to funnel stages: Cost to generate lead → applicant → qualified → selected
3. Calculate blended cost per qualified candidate
4. Run Cohort 2 with systematic cost tracking from day one
5. Identify cost reduction opportunities without quality compromise

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Complete cost breakdown documented for Cohort 1
- [ ] Cost per qualified candidate calculated with confidence
- [ ] Cost trajectory identified (does it decrease with scale/learning?)
- [ ] Benchmark against comparable programs (MBA, exec ed, coaching)
- [ ] Viable path to sustainable unit economics identified

**Current status:** ❌ Not measured (no systematic tracking in Cohort 1)

**Owner:** Operations lead + Finance (if exists)

**Timeline:** Retrospective (immediate) + Cohort 2 real-time tracking

---

### 3. Downstream Recognition of Candidate Value

**Assumption:**
Partners in the ecosystem (brokers, financiers, SME sellers) perceive tangible value in accessing candidates selected and prepared by Re-New—and that value is sufficient to sustain the business model.

**Risk if false:**
Even with a working candidate engine, the market may not recognize enough differentiated value to engage deeply or financially support the model. Re-New could produce great candidates that the ecosystem treats no differently than self-sourced buyers.

**Validation approach:**
1. Structured interviews with current partners (brokers, lenders):
   - Do they perceive Re-New candidates as higher quality?
   - Would they pay for access? How much? In what form?
   - How does Re-New value compare to their current sourcing costs?
2. Test introductions: facilitate candidate-broker meetings and gather feedback
3. Measure partner behavior: Do they prioritize Re-New candidates vs. others?
4. Run small monetization experiments (if partners signal willingness):
   - Pilot success fee with one broker
   - Test referral fee with one lender
   - Offer "early access" tier and measure uptake

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] >70% of partners rate Re-New candidates as "significantly better" than typical buyers
- [ ] At least 3 partners express explicit willingness-to-pay (even if amounts TBD)
- [ ] Evidence of behavioral preference (faster response, more attention, better terms)
- [ ] Successful pilot monetization with at least 1 partner
- [ ] Clear understanding of competitive alternatives and our differentiation

**Current status:** ⚠️ Positive anecdotal signals, not systematically tested

**Owner:** Partnership lead + Founding team

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026 (structured partner research)

---

## Important Assumptions (Tier 2)

### 4. Team Configuration and Continuity

**Assumption:**
The core founding team remains committed and operationally engaged for the next phase of execution (12-24 months).

**Risk if false:**
Without clear alignment on roles, availability, and structure, the project may lack leadership continuity or struggle to onboard partners/funders. Uncertainty around team commitment is a major red flag for investors and early employees.

**Validation approach:**
1. Explicit conversation among founders:
   - Time commitment realistic (hours/week) for next 12 months?
   - Willingness to go full-time if validation succeeds?
   - Equity/legal structure clarity
   - Decision-making authority and governance
2. Document answers and alignment in writing
3. Socialize with key advisors/stakeholders for feedback
4. Create contingency plans for scenario where one founder needs to step back

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Written team commitment agreement (informal is fine, but explicit)
- [ ] Clear roles and responsibilities for next phase
- [ ] Governance structure defined (how are decisions made?)
- [ ] Legal/equity structure finalized or clear timeline to finalize
- [ ] No major uncertainties that would block fundraising or hiring

**Current status:** ⚠️ Partially clear, needs formalization

**Owner:** Founding team (collective)

**Timeline:** Immediate (before seeking external capital or making hires)

---

### 5. Funnel Conversion & Leakage

**Assumption:**
The candidate funnel—from awareness to selection—converts efficiently without excessive drop-off at key steps.

**Risk if false:**
If 90% of candidates drop mid-process (e.g., due to unclear expectations, poor UX, or bottlenecks in screening), then even strong top-of-funnel efforts become unsustainable. High leakage indicates broken value proposition or poor execution.

**Validation approach:**
1. Map Cohort 1 funnel with conversion rates:
   - Awareness → Landing page visit
   - Visit → Application started
   - Started → Application completed
   - Completed → Phone screen
   - Phone screen → Assessment
   - Assessment → Finalist
   - Finalist → Selected
2. Identify drop-off points with qualitative research (why did they leave?)
3. Test improvements in Cohort 2 (messaging, process, touchpoints)
4. Benchmark against comparable funnels (job applications, MBA programs, etc.)

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] Full funnel mapped with conversion rates at each stage
- [ ] Drop-off reasons identified and categorized
- [ ] At least 2 high-impact improvements tested in Cohort 2
- [ ] Funnel conversion comparable or better than benchmarks
- [ ] No single "leak point" causing >50% drop-off

**Current status:** ⚠️ Cohort 1 funnel partially measured, not systematically analyzed

**Owner:** Growth/Operations lead

**Timeline:** Retrospective (immediate) + Cohort 2 iteration

---

### 6. Partner Activation / Monetization Readiness

**Assumption:**
Ecosystem partners (finance, brokers, advisors) are not only interested but ready to act—i.e., to activate, pay, or integrate Re-New into their flow.

**Risk if false:**
We may discover that partners like the concept but aren't operationally ready or willing to transact, delaying monetization indefinitely. Interest ≠ commitment.

**Validation approach:**
1. Move beyond positive feedback to test readiness:
   - Ask partners to commit to pilots (even unpaid)
   - Propose specific integration points (how would this work in practice?)
   - Test revenue-share or referral fee terms in conversation
   - Seek soft agreements (LOIs, MOUs, term sheets)
2. Identify blockers to activation (internal approvals, tech integration, budget cycles)
3. Document partner "ladder of commitment" (interest → meeting → pilot → contract)

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] At least 3 partners agree to pilot partnerships (defined scope, timeline, success metrics)
- [ ] At least 1 partner commits to formal agreement (even if revenue-neutral initially)
- [ ] Clear understanding of partner procurement/approval processes
- [ ] No systematic blockers identified that we can't address
- [ ] Partners willing to provide testimonials or case studies

**Current status:** ⚠️ Interest expressed, readiness untested

**Owner:** Partnership lead

**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026

## Open Points / Areas of Uncertainty

### 7. Selection Depth: Why 60 → 1?

**Question:**
Was the selection of only one candidate from 60 applicants intentional (quality bar) or capacity-constrained (couldn't support more)?

**Why it matters:**
- If intentional: High selectivity is defensible, but raises questions about funnel efficiency
- If capacity-constrained: We're leaving value on the table (other strong candidates could be matched to brokers, offered tier-2 opportunities, etc.)

**Validation needed:**
- Review Cohort 1 selection rationale
- Assess how many additional "qualified but not selected" candidates exist
- Explore opportunities to monetize broader funnel (tiered offerings, broker referrals, alumni network)

**Owner:** Founding team

**Timeline:** Post-Cohort 1 retrospective

### 8. Italy Expansion Timing

**Question:**
Should we launch a lightweight pilot in Italy early (leveraging Italian trio capacity), or fully validate the French model first before any geographic expansion?

**Why it matters:**
- Standard startup advice: validate one market fully before expanding
- Our unique situation: Italian trio already embedded, low incremental cost, potential learning acceleration
- Risk: distraction from French validation

**See:** [expansion-thesis.md](expansion-thesis.md) for full analysis

**Decision framework:** Proceed with Italian pilot only if:
- French core assumptions showing positive early signals
- Italian network mapping (Phase 0) complete and promising
- Clear constraints to prevent distraction

**Owner:** Founding team (collective decision)

**Timeline:** Decision in Q1 2026 based on Q4 2025 French validation progress

---

### 9. Partner Network Clarity

**Question:**
Which current partners are structurally critical to the model, and which are playing limited/credibility roles?

**Why it matters:**
- Need to distinguish "core partners" (can't operate without them) from "nice to have"
- Prioritize deepening relationships with core partners
- Avoid spreading attention too thin across partners who provide only marginal value

**Validation needed:**
- Map each partner to value chain stage (sourcing, screening, matchmaking, financing, support)
- Assess: What happens if we lose this partner?
- Identify gaps: What functions lack strong partners?
- Formalize: Which partners need contracts vs. which are informal?

**See:** [stakeholder-map.md](../knowledge/stakeholder-map.md) for partner mapping

**Owner:** Partnership lead

**Timeline:** Q4 2025

## Philosophy: Assumptions as Assets

Most early-stage ventures fail because they scale on unvalidated assumptions. By explicitly naming our assumptions, designing validation approaches, and committing to following the evidence—we dramatically increase odds of success.

**This document is not a weakness—it's a strength.**

Investors and operators respect founders who:
- Know what they don't know
- Design rigorous validation
- Change course based on evidence

Re-New's commitment to assumption validation (before fundraising, before large bets) is a competitive advantage.
