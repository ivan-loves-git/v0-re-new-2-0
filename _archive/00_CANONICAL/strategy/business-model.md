## Change History

### November 12, 2024 - Complete Business Model Pivot
**What Changed:**
- FROM: Marketplace connecting candidates to deal makers
- TO: SaaS platform serving entrepreneurs directly
- Customer becomes the entrepreneur, not the intermediary
- Revenue model shifts from commission to subscription + services
- Technology focus on journey support, not just matching

### Previous Model (Archived)
The previous model focused on selling candidates to deal makers for a percentage of fees. This proved unviable due to low candidate volume and monetization probability. New model directly serves entrepreneurs as customers with a comprehensive platform solution.
