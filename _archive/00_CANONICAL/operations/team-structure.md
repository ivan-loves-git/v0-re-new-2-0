# Team Structure & Commitments

## Team Assessment: Strengths & Open Questions

### Current Strengths

The founding team has demonstrated:

✅ **Strong capabilities** - Successfully mobilized partner ecosystem and generated early traction
✅ **Natural market fit** - Deep understanding of SME succession dynamics and entrepreneurship
✅ **Strategic clarity** - Ability to articulate vision and execute against it
✅ **Operational execution** - Delivered Cohort 1 with limited resources (60 candidates, 300+ deal pipeline, <1 year)
✅ **Network activation** - Leveraged personal networks to build credibility and early partnerships

**From a venture standpoint, this is a significant asset.**

---

### Open Questions (To Be Addressed)

While the team shows strong fit and credible track record, clarifying the following will be essential to de-risking next steps and building confidence among future partners and stakeholders:

#### 1. Commitment Over Time

**Question:** How much time and energy can each founder realistically contribute over the next 12-24 months?

**Why it matters:**
- Re-New is entering a phase where **consistent delivery is critical** (systematic validation, Cohort 2, partner development)
- Uncertainty around founder availability creates execution risk
- Part-time commitment may be fine for validation phase, but scaling requires different commitment levels

**To be clarified:**
- Current time commitment (hours/week) for each founder
- Availability constraints (other jobs, projects, personal commitments)
- Conditions under which founders would go full-time
- Runway considerations (how long can founders work without salary?)

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially clear, needs explicit conversation

---

#### 2. Operational Clarity

**Question:** How is the team formally structured—both in terms of roles and legal/equity arrangements?

**Why it matters:**
- Impacts ability to scale, onboard external contributors, and raise capital
- Investors want clarity on who owns what and who decides what
- Operational ambiguity creates friction when making fast decisions

**To be clarified:**
- **Roles & responsibilities:** Who owns what? (strategy, operations, partnerships, product, etc.)
- **Decision-making:** How are decisions made? (consensus, lead founder, domain ownership?)
- **Legal structure:** Is there a legal entity? If not, when will one be formed?
- **Equity/ownership:** What's the ownership structure? (Equal split? Contribution-based? TBD?)
- **Governance:** How will disputes be resolved? What happens if a founder wants to leave?

**Status:** ⚠️ Limited visibility, needs formalization

---

#### 3. Long-Term Commitment

**Question:** Are founders committed to Re-New for the 5-10 year journey required to build a significant business?

**Why it matters:**
- Building a platform business (not a consulting practice) takes years
- Investors invest in teams as much as ideas
- Early employees and partners need confidence in founder commitment

**To be clarified:**
- Founder conviction level (0-10 scale: "how committed are you?")
- Vision alignment (same end-state goal, or different expectations?)
- Life circumstances that could change availability (family, health, other opportunities)

**Status:** ⚠️ Assumed but not explicitly discussed

---

## Recommended Team Structure (Current Phase)

### Phase: Pre-PMF Validation (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)

**Team mode:** Part-time, validation-focused, founder-led

**Roles needed:**

| Function | Owner | Time Commitment | Key Responsibilities |
|----------|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Overall Strategy & Vision** | TBD (Founder 1?) | 10-15h/week | Set direction, make key decisions, fundraising prep |
| **Operations & Execution** | TBD (Founder 2?) | 10-15h/week | Cohort delivery, process design, metrics tracking |
| **Partnerships & Ecosystem** | TBD (Founder 3?) | 10-15h/week | Broker/lender relationships, partner activation |
| **Candidate Sourcing** | Shared / TBD | 5-10h/week | Marketing, funnel management, lead gen testing |
| **Italian Pilot (if activated)** | Italian Trio | 5h/week each | Network mapping, partner activation, pilot execution |

**Gaps to address:**
- No dedicated marketing/growth owner (critical for testing repeatable sourcing)
- No finance/operations support (needed for unit economics tracking)
- No technical/product support (if platform development becomes priority)

---

## Recommended Team Structure (Post-PMF)

### Phase: Scaling (H2 2026+)

**Team mode:** Full-time, scaling-focused, functional specialization

**Core team needed:**

| Function | Hire Priority | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **CEO / General Manager** | Founder or external | Overall leadership, fundraising, vision |
| **Head of Partnerships** | High | Critical to model; broker/lender relationships are the engine |
| **Head of Candidate Experience** | High | Cohort delivery, selection process, candidate success |
| **Head of Growth / Marketing** | High | Systematic candidate sourcing (can't rely on founders) |
| **Operations Manager** | Medium | Process design, metrics, efficiency, compliance |
| **Finance / Business Ops** | Medium | Unit economics, fundraising support, contracts |
| **Product / Tech Lead** | Low-Medium | If building platform; otherwise defer |

**Total team size post-PMF (Year 1 of scaling):** 5-7 people

---

## Italian Trio: Unique Asset

### Team Composition

The "Italian trio" (Fabio, Gabriele, Ivan) represents a **unique strategic asset** for Re-New:

- **Native expertise:** Language, culture, networks already established
- **Embedded access:** No need to "break into" Italian market from scratch
- **Low incremental cost:** Capacity exists without distracting from French core
- **Parallel validation:** Can test assumptions in second market while validating first

### Proposed Role (Validation Phase)

**Scenario 1: Italian pilot activated (Q1 2026)**

- Fabio: Lead Italian broker/advisor relationships
- Gabriele: Lead Italian candidate sourcing and community building
- Ivan: Lead Italian financing partnerships and ecosystem mapping

**Time commitment:** 5-10 hours/week each during network mapping and pilot phases

**Scenario 2: Italian pilot paused**

- Trio remains engaged in French validation
- Italian network mapping completed "on background" (low effort)
- Revisit in Q2 2026 based on French validation results

## Team Capability Map

### Current Team Strengths

| Capability | Team Strength (1-5) | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Entrepreneurship / Business Building** | 5 | Founders have startup/business experience |
| **SME / Succession Domain Expertise** | 4 | Strong understanding, some gaps in financing/legal |
| **Partnership Development** | 5 | Proven ability to activate ecosystem |
| **Candidate Sourcing & Selection** | 3 | Cohort 1 success, but repeatability unproven |
| **Operations & Process Design** | 3 | Scrappy execution, needs systematization |
| **Fundraising & Investor Relations** | ? | Untested (no external capital raised yet) |
| **Marketing & Brand Building** | 3 | Personal networks strong, systematic marketing untested |
| **Finance & Unit Economics** | 2 | Limited tracking in Cohort 1, needs rigor |
| **Legal / Compliance** | 2 | Reliant on external advisors |
| **Product / Technology** | 2 | No tech product yet; platform is conceptual |

**Key gaps to address:**
- **Finance/operations rigor** (need for validation phase)
- **Systematic marketing** (critical for repeatability validation)
- **Fundraising capability** (needed if PMF achieved and scaling begins)

## Commitment Clarity Framework

### Founder Alignment Exercise (To Be Completed)

**Objective:** Surface any misalignment early, before making commitments to partners/employees/investors

**Questions for each founder:**

1. **Conviction:**
   - On a scale of 0-10, how confident are you that Re-New can become a large, defensible business?
   - What would need to be true for you to rate it 10/10?

2. **Commitment:**
   - How many hours/week can you realistically commit over the next 6 months?
   - Under what conditions would you go full-time?
   - What's your personal runway (how long can you work without salary)?

3. **Role:**
   - What role do you want to play in Re-New long-term?
   - What are you best at, and what energizes you?
   - What do you explicitly NOT want to do?

4. **Vision:**
   - What does "success" look like for Re-New in 5 years?
   - What kind of company do you want to build? (Lifestyle business? VC-backed scale-up? Social impact?)
   - What are your personal goals from Re-New? (Financial? Impact? Learning? Network?)

5. **Trade-offs:**
   - What are you willing to sacrifice to make Re-New succeed?
   - What are you NOT willing to sacrifice?
   - If Re-New requires a hard pivot, how do you feel about that?

6. **Contingencies:**
   - What life circumstances could change your availability?
   - What would cause you to leave Re-New?
   - How do we handle that gracefully if it happens?

**Output:** Written alignment document (can be informal) capturing each founder's answers

## Legal & Equity Structure (To Be Finalized)

### Current Status

**To be clarified:**
- Is there a legal entity? (SAS, SARL, other?)
- Who owns what percentage?
- Is equity vesting in place? (Critical for multi-year commitment)
- What happens if a founder leaves?

### Recommended Structure (Pre-Funding)

**Entity:** French SAS (Société par Actions Simplifiée)
- Flexible governance
- Favorable for eventual fundraising
- Standard for French startups

**Equity split options:**

**Option 1: Equal split**
- Each founder: 33.3%
- Pro: Simple, signals equal partnership
- Con: Ignores different contribution levels (past & future)

**Option 2: Contribution-based**
- Weight by: time commitment, domain expertise, network value, capital invested
- Pro: Perceived as "fair" if contributions are asymmetric
- Con: Subjective, potential for conflict

**Option 3: Dynamic equity (slicing pie model)**
- Equity allocated over time based on actual contribution
- Pro: Aligns with reality (who actually does the work)
- Con: Complex, requires tracking

**Recommendation:** Equal split with vesting (see below) unless there's clear asymmetry in commitment.

**Vesting schedule (critical):**
- 4-year vesting
- 1-year cliff
- Monthly vesting thereafter

**Why vesting matters:** Protects remaining founders if someone leaves early. Non-vested equity returns to company.

**Founder departure terms:**
- Good leaver: keeps vested equity (leaves on good terms)
- Bad leaver: company can repurchase even vested equity (leaves due to misconduct, breach, etc.)

---

## Governance & Decision-Making

### Pre-PMF Phase (Current)

**Decision-making mode:** Consensus-driven, informal

**Works when:**
- Team is small (2-4 people)
- Everyone is deeply involved
- High trust and alignment

**Breaks when:**
- Urgent decision needed and someone unavailable
- Disagreement that can't be resolved through discussion
- Team grows beyond founders

**Recommendation:** Operate by consensus, but designate a **tie-breaker** for deadlocks (typically CEO/lead founder role)

---

### Post-PMF Phase (Scaling)

**Decision-making mode:** Domain ownership with CEO oversight

**Example domains:**
- Partnerships: Partnership lead owns (with CEO strategic input)
- Candidate selection: Candidate Experience lead owns (with quality checks)
- Budget: CEO + Finance own
- Brand/messaging: Marketing lead owns (with founder/CEO approval)
- Hiring: CEO + hiring manager co-own

**Board of Directors (post-fundraising):**
- 2 founder seats
- 1-2 investor seats
- 0-1 independent seat (optional)

**Decisions requiring board approval:**
- Fundraising and major financing
- Hiring/firing C-level executives
- M&A or major partnerships
- Budget changes >X%
- Equity grants

---

## Hiring Philosophy & Sequencing

### Validation Phase (Current)

**Hire:** External advisors, fractional support, contractors

**Don't hire:** Full-time employees (too early, too risky)

**Rationale:** Need to prove business model before committing to payroll

**Exception:** If external funding secured for validation phase, consider 1-2 strategic hires (e.g., Head of Growth to test repeatability)

---

### Scaling Phase (Post-PMF)

**First hires (priority order):**

1. **Head of Partnerships** - Most critical to model; can't scale on founder relationships alone
2. **Head of Growth/Marketing** - Need systematic candidate sourcing; can't rely on founder heroics
3. **Operations Manager** - Free up founders from execution details; systematize processes

**Next hires:**
4. **Finance/Business Operations** - Unit economics rigor, investor reporting, contract management
5. **Candidate Experience Manager** - Cohort delivery, mentorship coordination, success tracking
6. **Italy Country Lead** (if Italian expansion greenlit) - Dedicated leadership for second market

**Hire slowly, fire fast:**
- Early hires are culture-defining; get them right
- Mis-hires at this stage can kill momentum
- Be willing to part ways if not working (grace, but speed)

---

## Compensation Philosophy

### Validation Phase

**Founders:** Sweat equity only (no salary)

**Advisors:** Equity (0.25-1%) or hourly consulting fees

**Contractors:** Market rates for defined projects

**Rationale:** Preserve cash until revenue or funding secured

---

### Scaling Phase (Post-Funding)

**Founders:** Below-market salaries + meaningful equity

**Early employees:** Competitive salaries + equity (0.5-2% depending on role, seniority, timing)

**Advisors:** Smaller equity grants (0.1-0.5%) for ongoing strategic support

**Equity pool:** Reserve 15-20% for employee equity (pre-seed/seed stage)

---

## Team Roadmap

### Immediate (Q4 2025)

- [ ] Complete founder alignment exercise (commitment clarity)
- [ ] Formalize roles and responsibilities for validation phase
- [ ] Establish legal entity and equity structure (with vesting)
- [ ] Document decision-making process and tie-breaker mechanism
- [ ] Confirm Italian trio availability for Phase 0 network mapping

### Near-term (Q1-Q2 2026)

- [ ] Assess need for fractional/contract support (growth, finance, operations)
- [ ] If Italian pilot activated: define trio roles clearly
- [ ] Prepare hiring plan for post-PMF phase (contingent on validation success)
- [ ] Begin board/advisor recruitment conversations (for post-funding)

### Post-PMF (H2 2026+)

- [ ] Finalize fundraising and secure capital for scaling
- [ ] Make first 2-3 hires (partnerships, growth, operations)
- [ ] Transition founders to clear functional ownership (CEO, COO, CPO, etc.)
- [ ] Establish board of directors (founders + investors)

---

## Success Metrics: Team Health

**Validation phase:**
- [ ] All founders clear on time commitment and availability
- [ ] Legal entity and equity structure finalized
- [ ] No ambiguity on who owns key decisions
- [ ] Regular team check-ins (weekly sync minimum)
- [ ] Documented roles and responsibilities

**Scaling phase:**
- [ ] Key hires made and productive within 90 days
- [ ] Founder roles formalized (not everyone doing everything)
- [ ] Team culture codified (values, working principles)
- [ ] Low attrition (early hires stay >2 years)
- [ ] High engagement (team energized, not burned out)

---

## Open Questions

**Immediate:**
- What is each founder's current time commitment, realistically?
- Is there a lead founder / CEO, or is this a co-CEO model?
- Have founders discussed worst-case scenarios (what if someone wants out)?

**Strategic:**
- Do founders want to build a VC-backed scale-up, or a profitable lifestyle business?
- Are founders aligned on exit expectations (acquisition, IPO, long-term independence)?
- What are non-negotiable cultural values for Re-New?

**Tactical:**
- If we need to hire before fundraising, where does cash come from?
- What advisor/mentor support would most accelerate Re-New right now?
- How do we onboard the first employee in a way that sets culture?
