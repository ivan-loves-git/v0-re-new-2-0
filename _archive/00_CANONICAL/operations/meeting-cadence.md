## Weekly Team Sync

**Cadence:**
- **October 2024:** Weekly
- **November 2024 onwards:** Bi-weekly (due to travel commitments)

**Duration:** 45 minutes maximum

**Structure:**
1. **ICP/Academic Updates (10-15 min):**
   - Progress on ICP deliverables

   - Upcoming deadlines or requirements

2. **Workstream Updates (30 min):**
   - Scale & Refine (Nacho, Ivan): Campaign, website, platform status
   - Monetization (Alex): Partner outreach, revenue model progress
   - Expansion (Piera, Gabriele): Exploration progress, research findings

3. **Strategic Discussions (Ad-hoc):**
   - Major decisions requiring team input
   - Blocker resolution
   - Cross-workstream coordination

**Attendance:**
- Expected: All team members
- Flexibility: Can miss if unavoidable, must review notes and honor decisions made
- Async participation: Meeting notes + comment on Notion if unable to attend

**Output:**
- Meeting notes published in `04_MEETINGS/weekly-sync/` within 24 hours
- Action items assigned with owners and due dates
- Decisions logged if strategic (see `03_DECISION_LOG/`)

## Founder Check-ins

**Schedule:** Once per month
**Participants:** Full team + Bertrand (founder) + other founders as needed
**Purpose:**
- Share progress across all workstreams
- Get founder feedback and strategic guidance
- Align on major decisions (fundraising, hiring, partnerships)

**Note:** On weeks when founder meeting occurs, team may skip weekly sync to avoid meeting overload

## Academic Advisor Meetings

**Francesco (Academic Advisor):**
- Schedule: Ad-hoc, typically monthly or as needed
- Next confirmed: October 27, 2024, 6:00 PM
- Purpose: ICP guidance, academic requirements alignment

**Martin Kuh (Tutor):**
- Schedule: Ad-hoc, typically every 2-3 weeks
- First meeting: Week of October 20-24, 2024
- Purpose: Tutorial support, ICP methodology guidance, deliverable review

**Joint meetings preferred:** Bertrand advised having combined founder + advisor meetings when possible to avoid conflicting guidance

## Workstream-Specific Meetings

**Expansion Team (Piera, Gabriele, Alex):**
- Ad-hoc meetings to define exploration framework
- Frequency: As needed based on research phase
- First meeting scheduled: Week of October 20-26, 2024

**Scale & Refine Team (Nacho, Ivan):**
- Daily async coordination via Slack/Notion
- Formal check-ins: Weekly sync sufficient
- Campaign-specific: As needed during active campaigns

**Monetization (Alex + Bertrand):**
- 1:1 meetings as needed
- Typically tied to founder check-ins

## Communication Principles

**Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:**
- Default to async (Notion comments, Slack threads) for non-urgent items
- Use weekly sync for decisions requiring full team input
- Reserve ad-hoc meetings for time-sensitive issues or complex discussions

**Meeting Norms:**
- Start on time, end on time (respect 45-min limit for weekly sync)
- Come prepared (review Notion pages, pre-reads if shared)
- Document decisions and action items (no "lost" decisions)
- If you miss a meeting, review notes within 24 hours

**Decision Authority:**
- Workstream leads can make tactical decisions autonomously
- Strategic decisions (scope changes, resource allocation, partnerships) require team consensus
- Founder approval needed for external commitments (partnerships, spending, legal matters)

---

## November 2024 Travel Context

**Why bi-weekly starting November:**
- Last week of November: Paris Global Horizon seminar + Re-New event + workshop
- First week of November: International seminar (multiple team members)
- Madrid electives and other course commitments
- By November, team will have established working rhythm (weekly in Oct builds foundation)
