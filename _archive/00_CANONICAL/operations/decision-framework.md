# Re-New Decision Framework

*Last updated: November 2024*

This document defines how decisions are made at Re-New, who has authority for different types of decisions, and how we resolve conflicts.

---

## Decision-Making Principles

1. **Speed over perfection:** Make reversible decisions quickly, invest time only in irreversible ones
2. **Data when possible, intuition when necessary:** Use evidence but don't paralysis by analysis
3. **Disagree and commit:** Voice concerns, but once decided, full support
4. **Default to action:** When uncertain between two good options, choose and learn
5. **Transparency always:** Document decisions and rationale for future reference

**When:** Direct discussion fails
**Process:**
1. Bring in neutral team member as mediator
2. Each side presents position (5 min each)
3. Mediator facilitates discussion

5. If resolved: document agreement

### Level 3: Team Discussion
**When:** Mediation fails or affects whole team
**Process:**
1. Add to next team meeting agenda
2. Each position presented objectively
3. Open discussion with all founders
4. Vote if necessary (majority rules)
5. If tie: CEO (Ivan) makes final decision

### Level 4: External Advisor
**When:** Fundamental disagreement threatening team cohesion
**Process:**
1. Agree on neutral external advisor
2. Present situation to advisor
3. Receive recommendation
4. Team decides whether to accept
