Ivan

Hey. Hello, hello. Ciao. 

Bertrand

How are you? Tright. Regional seminar with Alex. 

Ivan

It's a long story, that's If we start to to discuss that it's gonna take uh a good part of the meeting, I guess. That was great. 

Bertrand

I'm sure we have many updates to share on renew on both sides. How do you want to proceed? 

Alex

I'll tell you what we have from our side very shortly, but not doing this. So we had like brainstorming actually with uh with the team this morning and there's been some few proposals um from Gabrielle and Ivan. and I tried to summarize them in some slides so that you can review them. They are going more or less in the same direction, so that's what we have to share. 

Bertrand

Excellent. And what I have to share with you since we last discussed uh Many things progressed. I'm going to share my screen, it's easier. So you can see so you can see. Many things progressed on our side. Regarding the campaign, we have met like all the candidates we wanted to met so for the final so we will decide between those two and we will elect our our laureate and we will reveal the name of the laureate on the 26th of november during our event so I know Alex We will not be here because it's your big week. But uh yeah, we will have this event we host. We don't have candidates left where we review the applications. All these people are people I'm going to meet. They are currently taking appointments directly for my calendar. These are no show, okay. And these are people that we will work on. So these people we will coach them because they are super early. And what you shared Yvan this morning this morning is interesting from that regard. These are the people with whom I mean we will do the matching. Okay. These are people that are I mean advanced and more interested into our operating partner offer. Okay And these are specific cases. But just to say we start to work at this in Fletcher to categorize our repreneurs in a certain way. And one super important thing, it's in French, but I will do the voiceover. Together with Amélie and Antoine, I interviewed for the Blue Factory Seed program incubation. We have the feedback uh end of next week that uh We were not mature enough for this program, but they open the they keep the door open until we have made revenue So we need to make revenue and so they will take us. So I mean our ambition, you know it, I mean selecting raw owners, blah blah blah blah blah blah And this is how we start to frame our offer. And here you see a small icon, so it's who pays, who's the client. Here for the starter pack it's the repreneur. For the deep flow it's the repreneur. And here it's the partners who pay. or I mean when we put them into contact as you know a port affair so we bring business and so we have a share back and on the financing and so long story short Yes. Early stage candidates, we sell them the starter pack. advanced candidate, we set them the deal flow and we use them for the rest, due diligence and financing. Would that make sense? And so, I mean, long story short, the starter pack is six weeks to start your repreneurship journey and it's sold at 1. 250. Okay. And the deal flow offer, you know, where we match the opportunities with the um with the uh LED de cadrage. Depends on the size of your acquisition, but whatever happens you pay the subscription per month You pay a progress fee when you sell the LOI when it's signed by the by the seller. And you pay a percentage of the transaction, so which is capped. So we need to play the numbers. I don't say these are the final numbers, I'm just saying uh Too risky to go just on commission-based business model, too long and yeah So we need to monetize our candidates and this has been tested through interviews with repreneurs and yeah they they sign up for it. So just saying that the ones we've met until last week, so we've tell them it's free of charge, we just get money from the partners, we can't change the rule. You can say, oh, by the way. But those ones that we start to discuss with since Monday they know it's 

Ivan

They will have to pay something. They sign for it like they were willing to pay. They need to sign now 

Bertrand

Mm-hmm. So now I'm the bone of that uh what they say. 

Ivan

What what can you go back on the offer if I c just thirty seconds on what they pay for and who is gonna make that kind of uh I I didn't read maybe because it's French. For me it was uh not that easy to understand who what are we providing. It's gonna be you, some other expert, uh how does it work the starter pack? 

Bertrand

So starter pack is us So technically it's me. It's me providing the service. Deal flow me through the opportunities that I get from the partners, from the deal maker, etc. Here it's just putting them into contact with the lawyers, the CPA firms and or I mean the I mean the other partners that we have that can help them through their due diligence. Okay, and so we do the job but we get paid by the partner or the candidate it's meaning. Yeah and the financing so it's I mean it's uh through our partner prosperia if uh if we go uh if we go and finance the term date And for the components is fish de cadrage, financing plan, and good-based search plan uh interview guide with the checklist you know of when you meet the sellers when you meet the broker and with a scoring i mean with a scoring docket uh this is the I will say the exact summary pitch for the banks and investors and a pitch session where I'm pitching your project in 30 seconds, one minute, three minutes. 

Ivan

How much is effort from your side? I see six hours of coaching support? 

Bertrand

Six hours of coaching and I mean ballpark estimation is 10 hours of work will include it per candidate, not counting the prep time here that I will invest in preparing these steps and the script of all this. 

Alex

So what what's the sorry again the the point number three OQR and the details source deal and so on? 

Bertrand

It's the battle plan, the objective and key result, so I mean what you target, what you will do, and what you get. So it's it's let's say it's an elaborated action plan. of uh all what you need to do to deliver your on your objectives of acquiring a company. Yeah 

Alex

How do they get access to companies through How do they get in contact with companies that are to uh us? Yeah, right. Yeah 

Bertrand

for us because we've got the opportunities from the intermediaries and NNF firms and banks. So at this stage at this stage they are not really searching and we won't do any matching job because they don't know what they want we we start providing that you know once you know they are advanced are really at the end of the at the of the coaching cycle But I mean the deal flow part is really for advanced people. People who know what they are looking for because the deal flow, I mean You need to calibrate what they want and you need to make sure that you that you do the proper actions to get access to the opportunities and you need to transfer them the opportunities and then there is some work where you need to connect them with uh brokers and stuff. So what's your goal? 

Ivan

What's your goal for the next uh two to four weeks in terms of signing up for candidates? Do you have uh some uh forecast do you have some pool of candidates already evaluating do you will do do you have a flow of candidates meaning if you have zero now do you expect to have uh 15 candidates knocking uh 

Bertrand

at the door based on the website use what's your flow candidates bullpark I will meet more or less like 10 to 12 candidates uh until end of next week Um would uh would target like a fifty percent conversion definitely be interesting. If if we've got 50, it's a success. If we've got one third, it's okay. Below 33% of conversion is 

Ivan

Is this 12 already a subset? I didn't understand because from one point I understood that you wanted to start from the new ones, but oh sorry. 

Bertrand

Oh sorry. The 12 people I'm going to meet. Uh take for granted that all these people have been met already. All these people until that column. So The uh twelve people come from there, from those thirty here, okay 

Ivan

Okay, so it's a subset, but just out of uh thinking louder, then I shut up. If you don't have this Fletcher team and you start from fresh And new people come to the website and find you through LinkedIn or everything. What's your conversion rate expectation? How many per week? Let's say not conversion rate. How many per week do you do you think on a. 

Bertrand

Without campaign on an ongoing basis, you can so depends on the quality of the candidate we attract. But let's assume that Couple per weeks sixty sixty per cent of the candidates that end up here Sorry, I'm I'm tired in your room So 60% of the candidate that end up here we will meet with them So 40% we archive them directly because they are shit. Boom. Okay? So we meet 60% Out of this 60%, let's say we keep 50%. Okay, so I mean we end up I mean the 60 turn to be 50 so out of 10 candidates it's five And out of these five, uh we want a conversion of thirty-three persons. So cool. Yeah. And so yeah, so that means that uh yeah we need to do the the Mac uh the mathematics backwards to see if it fits them money-wise. So How many candidates we should get because then comes the question of you know can we attract that many candidates it's a new week. 

Ivan

Yeah. You have this pool of candidates, it's a very big resource like Um I think here you can leverage the the time you spent collecting these qualified candidates so I my my my two cents are don't waste the data that you can get out of them so if you got this this pool of candidates be very ruthless in asking them feedback and be very strategic in using them a be a bit bit by bit trying new things and see when you see things to to be working Excuse me Ivan? 

Bertrand

I missed something I guess. 

Ivan

No, no, I was just saying if you have about if you have expect to If you expect to have five to ten people that pay you that amount of money to go through a program with you, I think that's gold. Like you can get a lot of learnings from that journey. And I think that's uh kind of uh leveraging all you did in the campaign to get to this number. You mean you met a lot of people, you this weten tears, you got to this subset of very good people that could go and sign for it, which I really wish you to to get to the line uh don't go for the quick cash just uh use them wisely because it's uh it's a very precious resource 

Bertrand

Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly, exactly. I mean it's um I mean it's really important that everyone that works with us at some point that I've been with those guys speaking and I mean was a good experience and I recommend I mean it's keep We have no choice really. 

Alex

In terms of percentage of revenue, okay. Short term you see what you're showing here is gonna bring some revenue in the short term, correct? Yes. Yes. So then I think if you look at the um Eventually in the mid-to-long term, in terms of percentage of revenue, I guess the most should be coming from the second part of the process, you know, the end of the funnel what you were showing on the slide before, correct? Yeah, it's an ad ID. 

Bertrand

Exactly. Uh yeah. So I mean it's really bold both back simulation, but yeah. But needs to be challenging. 

Ivan

What is the time frame? Because my French understanding is ridiculous, you bet So w what is that what are these numbers? Like is it in in a month, in six months, in one year? 

Bertrand

Uh uh here it's let's say it's um Uh tak. Um here it's um But the assumptions are here. No, it's here So we've got 30 candidates in pool, we convert 33%, so we have 10 people that we work with. Max we can do 30 per year. etc etc and yes and then so other assumptions here for the for the deep flow and that makes us okay think that if we have 30 in a year. So it's the run rate for twelve months, assuming that yeah So we I mean it's already a learning and already a question mark is the success fee sufficient is uh I mean there are many questions we can ask. Oh and if the success fee is not sufficient then is our level of service enough to justify to charge more You see my points? Because here the success fee is super low. It's 0. 5, 0. 3 and it's capped. But we could get go and get more money, but it only depends on the value we offer at the end of the day. Why is you pointing to two revenue streams? 

Ivan

Like why are you not focusing on I I I I I can understand if the answer is we we're not gonna make enough money with with one like if you think because these numbers are very low for the single uh starter pack like 30k you're assuming 30 people are are making that per one year yeah is that because of uh uh you don't have enough pipeline like not enough people are interested in making that because you think too much time goes into making the the the revenue because these things seems to be scalable like you could really uh yeah 

Bertrand

If we have like freelancers and stuff, here is the assumption where let's say I'm the only operator and simultaneously like uh should be uh should be like ten twelve people max at the same time and not more than thirty per year uh Because I mean it's already like uh you got 10 hours per people so it's 300 hours. So 300 hours is something I need to I need to do other stuff as well. So yeah, but if we've got coach, I mean we can delegate this part because if If we get this clear and we can scale and multiply it and instead of having 30 we can have 120. If we've got the right acquisition upstream of to stream the pipeline, to fill the pipeline Yeah, with coaches that we train on uh on the methodology, yeah we can duplicate. 

Alex

I think what what we're discussing this morning, please correct me if I'm wrong, it's more actually more on the second part of the slide, correct? Like uh more on the deal, how yeah, how to make sure that your candidates And then basically we know that most of the money will come as soon as there is a deal. Yeah. And how to make sure that we have like the right match between the candidate and the deal, knowing that you can have a very even very wide variety of candidates with very different types of needs. So how to facilitate this this this matching yeah. 

Ivan

Yeah, there was this, but we also were discussing a bit the uh when when we look at the product we also were discussing about uh low money uh kind of technology must offer So I think we did also catch on the first half of the slide. Like we were more thinking about at least my platform it was about getting maybe Bertrand consulting. Did that extra hour well paid? as a plus and then having a lower barrier of entry with people that can access uh some kind of self-service uh tool and technologies and and and processes So we're doing today. 

Alex

I put your your proposal actually on slide. If you only can go through it. I don't know if it helps. 

Ivan

Yeah. Yeah, this this was the a bit about the logic of the platform. So basically having this platform that can enable the the entrepreneurs offering a broad set of tools that cover all the journey. So the first part of the journey could be a lot of people paying a little bit of money. for making things that could be automated very much. Readiness assessment. So these things that you can learn as Bertrand, you can learn to refine. over and over you can become an expert you can translate that experience into technology and you can make the technology available to a broad audience for for not that much money i don't know how much is you don't want to uh you know sell it for cheap but Then the DL flow hub is where you start to get asking a bit more money, you you per try put some sweating tears to put the deal flow, have a big numb. Yeah, I mean you could have that on LXL and make phone calls if people are not willing to give you the data, so this is not clear to me. But if you manage to get enough uh enough deals then at at you can we can get this second stage where people can instead of paying 20 euro they pay 200 euro they get access to the deal flow uh And then there is the third one, which I think is incrementally more about consulting, about asking money, you know, having moment with you, uh, is about uh You know, have uh calls with experts, track the progresses, make due diligence, make financial planning, maybe you have a legal office that you can sell as a connection and they can start uh leverage the network of partners. So the third step is more incrementally less and less people but more and more money per candidate And yeah, I did this was more or less the the point. So that's why I said maybe we are on both sides of the slide because on some way you want to get to the deal. Yeah, that's it's that's very the very last part. I don't think we the the platform covers that. Even if you see there is a couple of uh pages about post-acquisition support, but I think that's it's not very attractive to be honest. They are there, but uh I don't think that's super attractive But uh there is that part and then there is the um so it covers a little bit the flow. Um I was thinking uh Shalab, I was thinking maybe we can have this platform a place where the deal makers or the boutique uh players could maybe have a place where they can put their data autonomously but I really I don't have a clear picture of the market there it's uh I need to to listen a lot before I can make a suggest strategy 

Alex

So I mean there were a few ideas that we're discussing. I mean okay. Gabriel was like was a bit like going extreme. He was wanting to do like a kind of a tinder of kind of like a basically of a matchmaking. I'm not sure that we should call it like this because I think it's But we want to make sure there's some quality and then uh it's not like a free market. But it's kind of facilitating actually the the match between the candidates that you have selected and also the the companies that are actually ready to be on sale and to make sure that we have like a closed platform uh which allows actually uh a qualitative kind of matching. Yeah 

Bertrand

Yeah, I mean def definitely it's uh it's a closed gated community. It's not open to everyone. So yeah Um that's Yes. 

Alex

No the the because the main concern that we have is Based on your analysis, most of the money will come as soon as we get closer to the deal. And the whole process, the money is super good for the selection of the candidates But it looks like at the end of the tunnel the candidates are still on their own, they still need to find a company. And unless we kind of facilitate this process That's what the they will be bottleneck. If they don't find it, then the money doesn't come from you. You get money, but it's just basically on the on the first part of the process that you explained. I don't think that's what you want to that's where you want to to spend your your whole life actually working. 

Bertrand

No, no, no. I mean technology is an ele an enabler and a great enabler, but uh I mean the the real challenge is into connecting with how many as many uh MMA firm as possible to get as many GFs on the platform. But yeah, but definitely then the the the benefit of the platform is really to yeah automate something that's really super time consuming alternatively because uh if you've got 20 people that are looking for uh companies to acquire and you've got like 200 gifts 

Ivan

Then doing yourself the connection without automation is uh you got the matching which so you help people Discovery you make people making profile that facilitate the matching and then you can facilitate the deal. That's one point of view. My view it was more about that the whole acquisition journey of a company and this please I tell me if I'm seeing this wrong but you have now a mature perspective on this was that basically there was uh The journey of acquiring a company was a lonely journey, an unstructured journey, something that wasn't supported in a comprehensive way. geographically was very localized and fragmented so you can have maybe a good club in one city but then if you want to buy a company you are not from that city you never heard about the club etc so it was very localized So I think here the for me the strategic prosperity was there is a can I you know there is an opportunity to create This space in some way you call yourself the European accelerator at the beginning. You also had a bit this vision where you said this space was is broken and nobody is made uh made it well. Nobody made enough money to make it well. So I think we the game is to change it in making enough money to sustain to make it well. And I think this platform. Which could be renew uh backbone, it could very much facilitate or be a catalyzer for this. So you got people from on the website You start from LinkedIn, create a brand, then you get people on the website or on LinkedIn. Where these people go, there could be 20% of them that may be interested in acquiring a company that even evaluating if they are ready or not you you lose half of them because they don't know how to start they don't know the rules so having a place where they can get resources to self-evaluate to read about that the blog the the self-evaluating tool it's a way for not losing them and then you get an extra layer which is the letter let the cadras or whatever you know that that that thing where when you put all the all the the information inside that that makes the people reflective and move so long story short I think the true opportunities more than automate or more than make it cheaper with uh the time. I think here is an opportunity to to put all a lot of pieces together in a financially sustainable way So that you at the end you can create this funnel that it's kind of being for for the first time something that is not maybe just uh French speaking or not just for one region of France that is having a very interesting blog articles that then the AI can convert in very interesting tests, etc. And then of course you want the deal flow, you want that to be reach to be an opportunity. You have to foster all this all the steps. But it was my understanding that there was not one place where all the steps can be taken and this could be could be you know we could be the ones that make it because you have a lot of experience uh the European landscape is changing uh nobody have leveraged technologies now to make it these kind of things sustainable we could give it a try and and and make it happen and at this stage and then I shut up the the the sorry the the the the closing is marginal so at this in this View closing the deal is kind of not the one that makes the platform survive. It's isn't it's good of course. it's even for promotion but in theory you should be able to to make the things uh this financially sustainable even without the deal 

Alex

One point from my side, I think there's a point from Bertrand. Independently from the platform, I think the main point is how we can also communicate towards the provider of deals actually to convince and of of being um part of this process or taking part of this process or because that's at the moment please correct me uh Bertrand but uh uh most of the the the focus has been on the rope runners and also maybe the other partners or packing partners but towards actually the providers of these. I don't know if there has been a lot that has been done to um to uh integrate them in the whole process. I I don't know to be honest. 

Bertrand

For the moment only opportunity it was only opportunistic. Exactly. I got contacted by uh some of them in September through LinkedIn because they said, ah, interesting, please tell us more. And so we started to work uh I mean together and they start to share opportunities and so now I mean it's about I mean having uh let's say a systematic approach and say These are the ones we need to talk with. This is how we're going to work with them. And yeah. That's pretty much it. And yes, I yeah, this is what we are or this is where we're going and we are What's I mean on your side what you need to do is provide this data on our side what would the value we create is that we do the matching with our pool of X qualified uh acquirers. 

Alex

Correct. And also you provide support in order to make sure that these candidates are not only good candidates but can also get like proper financing. 

Bertrand

Yeah, yeah, but when I mean acquirers which people uh we have checked that I mean when we do the matching we've shown that they have the means to acquire what they want to acquire. 

Ivan

Do you help in find so do you see Thinking about the platform, do you see the financing support being relevant as a relevant page in the platform? Do you see partners being there? Do you see self-assessment being there? Do you see or you have seen all the people already kind of uh aware of their financial that they have to take care of financials before even thinking about it? 

Bertrand

So I mean normally the requires they know that they need to take care of this aspect for sure. Then we question is uh yeah uh have we worked a lot with uh I mean firms, uh I mean financing partners? No, we we have one, uh but we need to we need to Let's say strengthen this leg as well because deep flow is one thing and then financing is another thing. When I say thing, I mean issue pain point. Okay. 

Ivan

Yeah, so that that could be the discovery. So to me these are all opportunities where you say Yeah, to the broad audience that financing you have financing if you answer no then you could you could have a guide if you answer yes you can get the candidates a very tough question saying, yes, are you sure? Because I I heard 10 people telling me yes, but are you are you taught about this, this and that? So it's all opportunities where you can distill your your knowledge and and make it valuable for the for the broad audience. Yeah. 

Bertrand

So that it's I mean it's super interesting. Uh it's super interesting. It's uh I think it's part of I mean we need to prepare the the conversation on Monday night. Yeah I mean we need to update the team on because it's a big pipe what what we've been saying like We start to charge candidates. I mean it's just one I didn't agree uh shift in in in the approach so I mean it's important we update you as well it's important that we have like quality time for discussing this because it's I mean it's uh it's it's a game changer uh and so it means that this is the direction that takes the ICP project right for the next month. Which is an interesting one by the way. Is uh Pierre also on board with you? That's a good question. 

Alex

At the moment, no. The good thing is we managed to get like some really interesting discussion brainstorming. The four um yeah the four of us uh including Gabriele the Pierre at the moment still uh needs to be get be updated. Okay, okay. But we'll find a way anyway. 

Bertrand

Sure, sure. 

Alex

No, yeah, I think uh really I mean really like that I mean uh event The discussion that we have this morning for me was really interesting that the first time that I could see like uh the forest going in the direction. Maybe the the the the the way to get there is different, uh but at least it's um it was very healthy discussion. So yeah. 

Bertrand

Yeah, all good. Um Right. Um le Ivan le what I can do is play a bit with uh with the Figma uh I mean platform Just to you know until Monday I I have time this weekend because I don't move from home. Uh yeah play a bit with the platform So I can I mean share list of yeah share list of things that are on my mind of you know things that should be things that should not be in there um how it would fit with the offer that we've started to work on. If we step back a bit, I think that I mean we are going in the same direction. Like your train of thought Right now is aligned with powers because this platform thing It's like a super enabler or a super powered enabler to deliver on what we want to do with the starter pack and yield flow 

Ivan

Yeah if you if you give me the the decks you shared I think I could uh please. Sorry? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Alex

In your place, yeah 

Ivan

Yeah of course I I don't have an English version yet. No, it doesn't matter. I can I can manage but because I think this could it could be reframed a little bit into the into this step so right now uh okay the after the year part I will just removing it like it's uh it was more a concept but I think it's uh very much too much of a long term so after the year I will remove them Today you can this is fully functional, like you can log in as an administrator and you can add deals, you can add expert events, resources, they can all be mostly can be can be added. I think this needs a substantial review like these four I don't think should be at the center right now. I think this platform if that's your strategy you show on the deck it could be more representative of that. So maybe events, resources and network could be taking their own space being like the extra thing where You can access at any time. Resources, I don't know, maybe resources can be not everything could be free. Maybe we can have something with uh with a paid access that is now But again logically you said you want to have one layer when they go they pay you 1200. My proposal is to have a softer stage. So something that is more open that it can be more Well we can provide maybe just a sneak peek of what could be the action plan, the 100 steps uh OKR that you have. Like you can make that an Excel and give it to the guy or you can have 10% of that visible. and the other 90% blurred and and and and make it uh make it uh softer in in the process. So 

Bertrand

Yeah, this is what the France Reprise is actually doing on their platform. So yeah, I mean pay the subscription if you want to access this resource, if you want to access the deal flow in MM. So it's different because they don't select. We select uh uh but yeah I mean and yeah as you said it's in the 

Ivan

Look and feel it's blurred if you have not why you want to select like what's the advantage of selecting? I think the candidates could auto-select because if you offer them the next step there If you bring them on your platform and the next step is there with a clear price for the value, they could be the one deciding to move to the next phase. But maybe more pragmatically, here the core point is the flow deer flow. Do you think the deer flow can you can make this happen? Like can you create a database that is good enough? Here the concept is that you have the deals with the main characteristics a few a few stats and and these and then when you click it you have the acceleratory summary and and some things like financials And documents, you have to sign the NDA, this is signed, and then you got all the all the financials and and additional steps with documents to be downloaded. Do you think this is something you can create in a quantity that is meaningful for be sold even for a small fee? How fragmented is your so are your sources 

Bertrand

So it's super fragmented. It's uh uh it's random emails from MNFRs uh where I receive teasers when I sign an MBA. Uh uh, but I could I could do differently. I could do differently maybe. 

Alex

How can we make this platform attractive? What is the key USP of this platform? How can they be a pool? 

Bertrand

Yeah, well um it will be yeah what's What shitty is that? We need the right, I mean we need a critical size uh the critical mass of uh opportunities in the big flow. 

Alex

It's as simple as that. Yeah so can I ask questions because um even So who, so maybe you said it may and you understand, who would get access, okay, from the people who want to uh the repreneur Do one only the people would have been selected on went through the selection process from Will you get access to it as part of the process or do we open it to a wider spectrum of candidates? 

Ivan

My idea was to have it wider so that for example the readiness assessment could even be a blog post. where you say you know are you ready for that take the test could be something very a simple hook that brings you to the platform uh okay this is already the 

Alex

Because my point is one of the key USP of um the country we knew at the moment is quality. See what I mean? There's a funnel and at the end we've got like the right candidates. So means that When they are trying to match with the company, the company can say, oh, I got someone who's super qualitative. So the likelihood that it works is super high. If we broaden the access to wider spectrum of candidates, we're gonna lose this quality. We may have like a higher number of like um of connection that are made, but there would be a higher number of failures as well. That's why I'm I'm trying to understand what we want to achieve at the end. 

Ivan

What do you mean failure? Like because at the end once you got 100 people, 990 sheet, one is good 99 will make the readiness assessment and they will be structurally sheet on the numbers. So they they will do nothing else than having a very low matching score with the process but more realistically our platform will tell them where are you going man? This is you're not the right track, you're you're not doing great. 

Alex

No, exactly how do we measure success? Do we success when there's a deal is done or when there's a deal is done and six months later actually it fails 

Bertrand

No, no, but yeah, it's uh I mean it's the readiness to uh I mean take the entrepreneurial pass. 

Alex

Okay. 

Ivan

Strong credit credit, uh 10 years management, uh family support, uh but yeah, but you don't have previous experience, limited due diligence. uh whatever work life about like these are and then you can have the recommended action and then you for every every recommended action you you you can have a resource to support you but uh or you can have a coaching session if you feel uh 

Bertrand

So this could be manipulated a bit to Yeah, to have people uh yeah signing up for the uh early uh but yeah we need to I mean we need to define yeah what are the the things that we assess how we assess them and what are the conclusions so that it goes into our direction for sure. Yeah. 

Ivan

But the deal flow is the backbone. I think if we got the deal flow the rest will kind of uh fall into it will make sense but the big but the deal flow is a bit of the backbone of it. Because if we don't have it, then the other alternative is that you said Eva and I gonna, you know, this 1200 euro package. build a platform or let Sky help build a platform that I can spend one hour not ten hours on them and and that could also be a possibility a platform that is all about your 100200 package all around that you know load the data record the interviews that the the the 100 questions that you will have the there is a lot of things that you can do but I don't know if the the scale is less attractive. Like you could me you could just make two times the the the the flow but that is still uh 60k per year. Um yeah it's less attractive as a as a as a as a goal But if there is no deal flow or you can tell me even let's focus everything on a deal flow uh so that we can work together to make sure that there is an interest for the people to participate and we work on a strategy. Alex can work on a strategy and monetization. All is about having the boutique things use our platform to to load the the data trust it create try it's it's also a bit complicated you know it's not that easy uh maybe infeasible even 

Bertrand

But it's no but it's I I mean it's something they do already with others like with uh deal maker for instance 

Ivan

You see my point? Yeah, no, no, I think it's definitely doable in principle. It's about financially doable. Can we do that with our resources and our time available? So that's what uh it's really about you. You know how far we are from from having these guys uh logging in in our platform and giving us the information At least a general one. I can understand a platform that says if you sign the NDA, I will email the documents. It will not be on the platform. 

Alex

Now we need to make a survey to understand whether there is an interest in this kind of platform. Or what would they require from this platform or whatever? As you did last year actually on the other side of the funnel with the Eurofunnels 

Ivan

Or we as a team two point zero can, you know, make something uh We are cheaper. We can do we can skip the deal flow and make uh if we see there are interest we can just build something uh I don't know, I'm just thinking loudly here, you know. Um maybe we can just look at different uh 

Alex

So if we build something without knowing whether there is it fits the needs, it's very dangerous. You see what I mean? It's like launching a product, assuming there's a demand for it. 

Bertrand

Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, I mean uh the real I mean it's always I mean the platform is for the repreneur. Great. There is a demand on help me uh help me get ready to look for a company. help me find a company to acquire the this the need is validated then for the for the uh for for this person I mean Is it a platform the solution? Is it uh I mean the the technical technological layer can help for sure Anyway, it's required for us because the matching cannot be manual. So we need to find ways to automate it. So if it requires that We have the deal that at some point are submitted into the platform in a way that it can be an API, can be what I I don't know. I mean uh uh we need to find a way to have the 

Ivan

Because yeah this the scoring part was was uh is also something we can uh we can play What I like a lot about a platform is that is you can add brick over brick because you you have data. You can maybe If you have people using that, you can learn that maybe the expert section is very interesting for them because they are willing to pay someone for specific needs. Or you can cancel the expert section in one month after you understand that the one is using that. So uh but it's good to have a place where people are living and giving you a chance to to test. So that I think that's the one big we're big plus, but for sure you it's not easy to bring people on a platform. Making it free isn't per se a solution. A platform is expensive to build. No, no, no, that's that ends the subscription part Upgrade to pro. Yes. Give me the money. Get Bertrand personal number to call him overnight for 20 euro per month. You see if you get support is emergency support. Just for channel 

Bertrand

Yeah, I feel like uh you know that you're called sold yeah so that's amazing I think it's really worth uh the group discussion on Monday. I mean this this will be well received but until then anyway I will uh I will discuss with uh with uh Amélie and Antoine so um yeah we'll uh we'll be able to already give them uh first hints on where things are going and uh yeah much much appreciated and indeed I guess this this was a lively conversation this morning it was this morning right conversation with the team so it's good it's good um excellence 

Ivan

Yeah, but I I feel I feel Monday we really have to to pin pin some task because yeah I think even at the point even when they are not Um yeah, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but even if the platform or the technology isn't maybe needed too much Whatever we can leave a trace in this universe about our passage is needed at this point. Otherwise we we can only make uh updates on the conversation with Gabriela and T. So at one point I think everyone should kind of uh embrace one uh one uh desire, uh hopefully matching with Bertrand desire as well. Even if it's going you know against you to propose something that you know I will show you in a three month something that may be useful trust me uh it's better than stay without doing anything. Of course the best thing is to work together towards a goal, but you know you now you change the strategy. So what Gabriele can do with this, what Nasha can do this, what Niban can do this. Yeah, maybe we can find something, but Monday will be very hard that we will find this for everyone. And we have really two start. So yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah. 

Alex

The first slide that you showed at the beginning, you know, with the twist steps actually the the packet and then the deal flow and so on is Super critical because we know you need to know where we can bring added value in this process, where we can work more on. I think that Gabriele is more on the second part, more on the part, because that's he believes that's that's where the money is. He's more interested in watching that part. 

Bertrand

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna I mean I'm gonna share with you the the the slides I'm downloading them right now and sharing with you. Uh I do it in QPT if you want. Yeah.
