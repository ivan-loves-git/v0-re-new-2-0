## Objection Handling

### "Why would I pay when I can search myself?"
"You absolutely can spend 2-3 years finding and evaluating deals yourself. We help you do it in 12-18 months with higher success rates and professional tools. The time saved alone is worth multiples of our fees."

### "How is this different from business brokers?"
"Brokers represent sellers; we represent you. We help you through the entire journey, not just one transaction. Think of us as your acquisition operating system, not a one-time service."

### "Is this only for experienced buyers?"
"No  our Discovery module helps first-time buyers assess readiness and build capabilities. Experienced buyers can jump straight to our advanced tools. The platform adapts to your experience level."

### "What if I don't find a deal?"
"Our success rate is 3x the market average, but acquisition isn't guaranteed. Even if you don't close a deal, you'll gain valuable skills, network connections, and clarity about your goals. Many users find success on their second attempt with our learnings."

### "Why focus on France?"
"France has the most acute succession crisis in Europe and favorable acquisition financing. We're mastering one market before expanding. Belgium and Switzerland are next."
