## Vision

**Our ultimate aspiration:**

To become the default platform for entrepreneurial acquisitions in Europe, empowering thousands of entrepreneurs to successfully acquire and operate SMEs. In 5 years, Re-New will facilitate €1B+ in transactions annually, saving valuable businesses from closure and creating a new generation of business owners.

## Mission

**Our day-to-day purpose:**

We empower entrepreneurs to successfully acquire and operate SMEs through a comprehensive technology platform and on-demand advisory services. We transform the complex, opaque acquisition journey into a structured, supported process that dramatically improves success rates.

## The Problem We Solve

**The broken acquisition journey:**

Entrepreneurs seeking to acquire SMEs face a fragmented, inefficient, and expensive process:

**For Entrepreneurs:**
- **No structured path:** 2-3 years of wandering vs 12-18 months with guidance
- **Hidden opportunities:** Quality deals are locked behind broker networks
- **Expensive advisors:** Traditional M&A services start at €50K+ for small deals
- **Complete isolation:** No peers, mentors, or expert network
- **High failure rate:** 80% give up before finding the right business

**Market Impact:**
- 700,000 French SMEs need succession by 2032
- €90 billion of enterprise value at risk
- 60% of SMEs close due to lack of prepared successors
- 2.5 million jobs potentially lost

## Change History

### November 2024 - Complete Rewrite for Platform Model
**What Changed:**
- Vision updated from "catalyst for SME successions" to "default platform for acquisitions"
- Mission shifted from cohort acceleration to platform + advisory model
- Solution completely rewritten for SaaS platform approach
- Core service changed from "candidate as a service" to direct entrepreneur offerings
- Added differentiation, metrics, and long-term ambition sections
- Updated principles to reflect technology-first approach

**Previous Version (October 2024):**
The document previously positioned Re-New as providing "candidate as a service" for partners and running cohort acceleration programs. This reflected the intermediary model that has been superseded by the direct-to-entrepreneur platform approach.
