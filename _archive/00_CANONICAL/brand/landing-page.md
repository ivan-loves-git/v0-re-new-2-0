## Problem Section

### Section Title
**The Acquisition Journey Shouldn't Be This Hard**

### Pain Points (with icons)

**🔍 Endless Searching**
Quality deals are hidden behind broker networks. You spend years looking for opportunities that match your criteria.

**❓ Evaluation Paralysis**
Without frameworks and expertise, you can't tell good deals from bad. Every opportunity feels like a gamble.

**🏝️ Complete Isolation**
No mentors, no peers, no guidance. You're navigating complex transactions completely alone.

**💸 Excessive Costs**
Traditional advisors charge €50K+ minimum. For deals under €10M, that math doesn't work.

### Transition Statement
**There's a better way to acquire your business.**

## FAQ Section

### Section Title
**Common Questions**

**Who is Re-New for?**
Re-New serves entrepreneurs looking to acquire SMEs between €1M-10M in France. Whether you're an experienced operator or exploring acquisition for the first time, our platform adapts to your needs.

**How is this different from business brokers?**
Brokers represent sellers and focus on individual transactions. Re-New represents you throughout your entire journey, providing tools, education, and support beyond just matchmaking.

**Do I need acquisition experience?**
No. Our discovery tools help you assess readiness and build necessary skills. Many successful users started with no acquisition experience.

**What if I need help beyond the platform?**
Our advisory services provide expert support on-demand. From quick questions to full deal support, get help exactly when you need it.

**How long does the typical acquisition take?**
With Re-New, most entrepreneurs go from search to closing in 12-18 months, compared to 2-3 years independently.

**What size deals do you focus on?**
We specialize in €1M-10M transactions - large enough to be meaningful, small enough to be accessible.
