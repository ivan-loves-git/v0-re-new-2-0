# Stakeholder & Partner Network Map

## Purpose

This document maps the partner ecosystem that supports Re-New's value chain—both in France (where Cohort 1.0 validated the model) and in Italy (where we're exploring expansion potential).

**Key insight:** A partner network is not just a contact list. It's a **functional architecture** where each partner plays a specific role in the candidate-to-acquisition journey. Understanding this architecture enables us to:
- Identify gaps in current coverage
- Prioritize relationship deepening
- Replicate the model in new geographies
- Assess partner criticality for operations

---

## Partner Network Philosophy

### Network as Competitive Moat

Re-New's defensibility rests on three pillars:
1. **Proprietary candidate flow** (repeatable sourcing + selective vetting)
2. **Partner network density** (broker, lender, advisor relationships)
3. **Orchestration capability** (founders who can activate both sides)

The partner network is therefore **strategic infrastructure**, not just "nice to have relationships."

### Network-Model Fit

Just as product-market fit is critical, so is **network-model fit**: the ability to map, engage, and activate the right partners at each step of the repreneur journey.

**Re-New's value chain stages:**
1. Candidate Sourcing & Outreach
2. Candidate Screening & Selection
3. Access to SMEs for Sale
4. Candidate-SME Matchmaking
5. Financing the Acquisition
6. Post-Acquisition Support
7. Community & Brand Building

For each stage, we need **functional partners** who contribute specific capabilities.

## French Partner Network (Cohort 1.0)

### Network Maturity: Validated

The French ecosystem supported 60 qualified candidates and a 300+ SME pipeline in under a year. Key question: which relationships are **core** vs. **credibility-only**?

---

### 1. Candidate Sourcing & Outreach

**How we attract aspiring repreneurs to apply.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Flatchr** | Applicant tracking & sourcing tech | Tool/platform | Medium - Can be replaced |
| **Serena** | Visibility, credibility via VC networks | Amplification | Low-Medium - Brand value |
| **50 Partners** | Amplification and dealflow support | Ecosystem connector | Medium - Access to networks |
| **Prosperia** | Ecosystem visibility | Communications | Low - Marginal reach |

**Assessment:**
- Sourcing currently relies heavily on founder networks (to be validated in Cohort 2)
- Partners provide credibility more than systematic pipeline
- **Gap:** Need scalable, repeatable sourcing channels (content, paid, partnerships) independent of founder personal brands

**Priority actions:**
- Test Cohort 2 sourcing with reduced founder dependency
- Measure which partners actually drive applications (attribution)
- Consider dedicated sourcing partnerships (universities, MBA programs, entrepreneur communities)

---

### 2. Candidate Screening & Selection

**How we qualify, vet, and select the best entrepreneurial candidates.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Flatchr** | Workflow tools and recruitment funnels | Tool/platform | Low - Standard ATS |
| **Prisma Advisory** | Skill and mindset assessment | Assessment provider | Medium-High - Proprietary methodology? |
| **50 Partners** | Support in selection strategy | Advisory | Low-Medium - Non-exclusive |

**Assessment:**
- Selection process is largely internal (founder judgment)
- Prisma provides structured assessment, but how differentiated is it?
- **Gap:** Selection criteria should be codified and systematized (reduce founder dependence)

**Priority actions:**
- Document selection rubric explicitly
- Evaluate Prisma's unique value vs. alternatives
- Build assessment playbook that can scale without founders

---

### 3. Access to SMEs for Sale

**How we secure acquisition opportunities for candidates.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Entrepreneurs & Finance** | Pipeline of 300-400 SMEs | **Core partner** - active pipeline | **HIGH - Essential** |
| **C.R.A.** | Access to retiring business owners | Ecosystem connector | Medium - Specialized network |
| **Alvo** | M&A and succession network | Broker relationship | Medium - One of many brokers |
| **Prisma Advisory** | Deal structuring support | Advisory | Medium - Multi-role partner |

**Assessment:**
- Entrepreneurs & Finance is **structurally critical** (primary deal flow source)
- Other brokers provide diversification but not yet at scale
- **Gap:** Need 3-5 strong broker relationships to avoid single-point dependency

**Priority actions:**
- Deepen Entrepreneurs & Finance partnership (formalize agreement?)
- Activate 2-3 additional broker relationships with comparable pipeline quality
- Map entire French broker landscape (who else should we engage?)

---

### 4. Candidate-SME Matchmaking

**Where the repreneur is paired with a target company.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Entrepreneurs & Finance** | Deal facilitation | **Core partner** | **HIGH** |
| **Alvo** | Match-making and brokering | Active | Medium |
| **C.R.A.** | Facilitating trust with SME sellers | Connector | Medium |

**Assessment:**
- Matchmaking is where partner value perception is tested (do they prioritize Re-New candidates?)
- Currently facilitated by founders—needs systematization
- **Gap:** Process for matchmaking not yet codified (ad hoc founder orchestration)

**Priority actions:**
- Document matchmaking workflow (how does a candidate go from selected → introduced?)
- Measure partner behavior (speed of response, quality of introductions)
- Test partner value perception systematically (see [validation-assumptions.md](../strategy/validation-assumptions.md))

---

### 5. Financing the Acquisition

**Enabling repreneurs to secure funding.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Entrepreneurs & Finance** | Financing partner relationships | **Core connector** | **HIGH** |
| **Serena** | Investor network | Amplification | Low-Medium |
| **Carbon Cutter** | Occasionally involved via ESG funding ties | Niche | Low |

**Assessment:**
- Financing is currently **partner-mediated** (not direct Re-New relationships with lenders)
- Risk: if Entrepreneurs & Finance relationship weakens, financing access is compromised
- **Gap:** Need direct relationships with 2-3 lenders/investors who understand Re-New model

**Priority actions:**
- Map French lending landscape for SME acquisitions
- Establish direct relationships with lenders (not just through brokers)
- Test lender value perception (do they value Re-New prep? would they pay referral fees?)

---

### 6. Post-Acquisition Support

**Supporting repreneurs during transition and transformation.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Prisma Advisory** | Operational mentoring | Active | Medium-High |
| **Carbon Cutter** | Transition support (esp. on sustainability) | Niche | Low |
| **50 Partners** | General business support and mentorship | Ecosystem | Low-Medium |

**Assessment:**
- Post-acquisition support is **least developed** part of value chain
- Unclear if this is core to Re-New model or optional add-on
- **Gap:** No systematic post-acquisition program yet

**Priority actions:**
- Decide: is post-acquisition support core to Re-New or future monetization opportunity?
- If core: develop structured program with clear partner roles
- If optional: design as separate offering (advisory retainer, community membership)

---

### 7. Community & Brand Building

**Building reputation, trust, and pipeline momentum.**

| Partner | Role | Relationship Strength | Criticality |
|---------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **All partners** | Contribute to brand through association | Varies | Collective medium |
| **Flatchr** | Supports ongoing visibility | Tool | Low |
| **Prosperia** | Communications and community growth | Communications | Low |

**Assessment:**
- Brand building is early-stage (credibility through association)
- Re-New brand is still tied to founder personal brands
- **Gap:** Need independent brand authority (content, thought leadership, success stories)

**Priority actions:**
- Develop content strategy (owned media vs. partner amplification)
- Document and amplify Cohort 1 success stories
- Build "Re-New alumni" brand as candidates progress to acquisition

---

## Italian Potential Network

### Network Maturity: Unmapped → In Progress

The Italian network is currently **prospective**—relationships exist through the "Italian trio" (Fabio, Gabriele, Ivan) but have not been formally activated for Re-New.

**Objective:** Map functional equivalents to French partners, leveraging existing relationships where possible.

---

---

## Partner Criticality Matrix

### French Network: Current State

| Partner | Stage(s) | Criticality | Relationship Strength | Action |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Entrepreneurs & Finance** | Deal flow, Matchmaking, Financing | **CRITICAL** | Strong | **Formalize agreement** |
| **Prisma Advisory** | Selection, Deal support, Post-acquisition | High | Strong | Deepen + clarify scope |
| **Flatchr** | Sourcing, Selection | Medium | Transactional | Monitor, consider alternatives |
| **50 Partners** | Sourcing, Selection, Support, Brand | Medium | Moderate | Maintain, but not core |
| **Serena** | Sourcing, Financing, Brand | Medium | Moderate | Maintain for credibility |
| **C.R.A.** | Deal flow, Matchmaking | Medium | Moderate | Test actual deal flow contribution |
| **Alvo** | Deal flow, Matchmaking | Medium | Moderate | One of several brokers |
| **Carbon Cutter** | Financing (niche), Support | Low | Weak | Deprioritize unless ESG focus |
| **Prosperia** | Sourcing, Brand | Low | Weak | Marginal value |

**Key insight:** Re-New currently has **one critical partner** (Entrepreneurs & Finance) and several **moderate-value partners**. This creates single-point dependency risk.

**Strategic priority:** Diversify core partnerships—especially in deal flow and financing—to reduce dependency on any single partner.

---

### Italian Network: Target State

| Partner Category | Priority Partners | Criticality Target | Status |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Deal flow** | Arkios, Confartigianato, Cerved | **CRITICAL** | To be activated |
| **Financing** | Intesa Sanpaolo, Invitalia, Anthilia | High | To be explored |
| **Candidate sourcing** | Bocconi Alumni, Jobtech, Talent Garden | High | Warm relationships exist |
| **Advisory/Support** | Mentors4u, Bonfiglioli | Medium | Future |
| **Brand/Community** | Italian Tech Alliance, StartupItalia | Medium | To be explored |

---

## Partner Engagement Strategy

### Relationship Ladder

Partners progress through stages of commitment:

1. **Awareness** - Know Re-New exists
2. **Interest** - Positive conversations, exploratory meetings
3. **Engagement** - Active collaboration (intros, referrals, advice)
4. **Commitment** - Pilots, soft agreements, resource investment
5. **Partnership** - Formal agreements, integrated operations, revenue share

**Current state:**
- Most French partners at **Engagement** stage
- Entrepreneurs & Finance approaching **Partnership**
- Italian partners at **Awareness/Interest**

**Goal:** Move critical partners to **Commitment** stage with clear pilots/agreements in next 6 months.

---

### Activation Playbook

**For new partner relationships:**

1. **Research & Mapping** (Week 1)
   - Understand partner's business model, pain points, goals
   - Identify mutual value creation opportunity
   - Map decision-makers and influencers

2. **Warm Introduction** (Week 2)
   - Leverage existing network for intro (founder, advisor, other partner)
   - Share one-pager on Re-New value proposition for partners

3. **Discovery Conversation** (Week 3-4)
   - Explore partner needs and Re-New fit
   - Share early results/validation
   - Propose specific collaboration hypothesis

4. **Pilot Design** (Week 5-8)
   - Define scope: what will we test together?
   - Set success criteria: how do we measure value?
   - Agree timeline and commitments

5. **Execute & Learn** (Weeks 9-20)
   - Run pilot with regular check-ins
   - Gather feedback and iterate
   - Document learnings

6. **Formalize or Part Ways** (Week 21+)
   - If successful: negotiate formal agreement
   - If not: thank and move on (no hard feelings)

---

## Network Gaps & Priorities

### French Network Gaps

1. **Deal flow diversification** - Need 2-3 more broker relationships at Entrepreneurs & Finance level
2. **Direct lender relationships** - Currently mediated; need direct partnerships
3. **Systematic candidate sourcing** - Partners provide credibility, not pipeline
4. **Post-acquisition support** - Unclear if core to model; needs decision and development

### Italian Network Gaps

1. **Everything** - Network is prospective, not activated
2. **Critical path:** Arkios (or equivalent) + financing partner + candidate sourcing
3. **Cultural adaptation** - Process needs to fit Italian SME succession norms

---

## Next Steps

### French Network (Immediate)

- [ ] Formalize Entrepreneurs & Finance partnership (agreement, terms, exclusivity?)
- [ ] Activate 2 additional broker relationships for deal flow diversification
- [ ] Establish direct relationships with 2 lenders
- [ ] Measure partner value perception systematically (see [validation-assumptions.md](../strategy/validation-assumptions.md))

### Italian Network (Phase 0 - Q4 2025)

- [ ] Complete partner mapping across all categories
- [ ] Warm introductions to Arkios, Confartigianato, and Intesa Sanpaolo
- [ ] Assess partnership feasibility and appetite
- [ ] Document Italian market nuances vs. French

### Both Markets (Ongoing)

- [ ] Track partner engagement in CRM (move from spreadsheet)
- [ ] Measure partner contribution to candidate/deal flow (attribution)
- [ ] Quarterly partner review: prune low-value, deepen high-value
- [ ] Build partner playbook (how to activate, what "good" looks like)
