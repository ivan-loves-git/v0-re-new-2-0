Design for startups is hard.

After designing for 7 startups that exceed ~100M users, I've decided that few things are do or die. Design in 0-1 is extremely hard—but I've learned a lot along the way.

For designers/founders in startups, here's everything you need to know to build growth: 

(1) User engagement
- Time spent on site
- Number of page views
- Bounce rates
- Number of interactions with product or service
- Secondary of retention and revenue (read why below)

Measuring this can help you understand how well your product is meeting the needs of users, where they love most and where they might be churning.

(2) Activation rate

- % of users who take high-intent action (ie. on @ADPList
 its book a mentor)
- To track effectiveness of channels/campaigns
- Activation rate is usually solved with rapid experiments
- 90% of design tricks and copy changes can solve this
- AI proves to accelerate activation!

It can help you understand how effective your growth efforts are at driving users to take a key action, and optimize for it.

(3) Cohort retention - #1 IMPORTANCE

- I'd argue this is the MOST important
- First 7/30 days is critical @crystalwidjaja

- Agree with @andrewchen
 that "you can't fix bad retention"
- Retention is mostly nature > nurture
- % of users who continue to use product or service over time
- High retention can indicate that users find product valuable

Needless to say, this is an important metric of repeatability. Understand how well your product is retaining users over time.

(4) Net promoter score (NPS)

- Measures likelihood of users recommending product to others
- High NPS can indicate satisfied users who will act as brand advocates
- "How disappointed" survey is useless if you don't have retention and revenue

This is to help you understand how likely users are to recommend your product to others and how satisfied.

(5) Customer satisfaction (CSAT).

- Measures overall satisfaction with product or service
- Can be tracked through surveys

Nothing beats talking to users. You can identify areas for improvement and make changes to your product to better meet the needs of your users with this.

(6) Revenue growth

- #2 most important post-retention fit
- Measures growth in revenue over time
- Can be used to track overall success and identify areas for improvement
- Revenue is the earliest sign of PMF

Cashflow keeps companies alive. It provides insight into the financial health and success of the company. Design should drive revenue too.

tldr; design metrics to build growth:
1) User Engagement
2) Activation rate
3) Retention rate
4) Net promoter score (NPS)
5) Customer satisfaction (CSAT)
6) Revenue growth

Finally, speed is your best friend (not beauty) and don't give free stuff unless network effect is 100% important for you to win. Never compete on price, if you must, battle with highest quality.
