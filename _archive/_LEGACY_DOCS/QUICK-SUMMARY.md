## Current Business Model Status

### Monetization Strategy (Testing Through May 2025)

**Stream 1: Partner-Side (B2B Commission)**
- M&A firms pay commission for vetted repreneurs
- ~1% of deal value (~€25K per €3M acquisition)
- Limited scalability (20 deals/year max)

**Stream 2: Repreneur-Side (B2C Subscription)**
- Starter: €99/month (Discovery + learning)
- Professional: €249/month (Deal flow + tools)
- Enterprise: €349/month (Full platform + priority support)
- Operating Partner add-on: €1,500-3,000/month (post-acquisition coaching)

**Strategy:** Testing both in parallel, will choose winner in May 2025

### Key Pivot (November 2024)
- FROM: Candidates as "products" we sell to partners
- TO: Candidates as "customers" we serve directly via subscription
- Technology: ATS → CRM to enable service delivery at scale

## Key Documents to Read First

If you need to understand the current state quickly:

1. **START-HERE.md** (5 min read) - Orientation
2. **business-model.md** (20 min read) - Current strategy with change history
3. **DEC-20241101-dual-monetization-testing.md** (15 min read) - Revenue experiment
4. **DEC-20241101-ats-to-crm-operational-pivot.md** (15 min read) - Tech shift rationale
5. **product-overview.md** (15 min read) - Product vision

**Total: ~70 minutes for full context**

---

## System Quality Notes

✅ **Excellent:**
- Clear CANONICAL structure with change history (preserves evolution)
- Proper decision logging (7 key decisions documented)
- Well-designed folder hierarchy (scalable, logical)
- Product specifications methodology clear and templated
- Design system complete

⚠️ **Needs Attention:**
- Brand voice/messaging files empty (but audience & foundations exist)
- 47 of 52 page specs need detailed expansion (though batch specs exist as foundation)
- Monetization experiment tracking process (should formalize monthly updates)

---

## The Big Picture

Re-New has **transitioned from an accelerator/recruitment model to a subscription SaaS platform**. The documentation captures this pivot clearly:

- Strategic files show the shift from candidates-as-products to candidates-as-customers
- Product specs define a comprehensive platform covering the entire SME acquisition journey
- Monetization strategy is being validated through dual testing (partner commission vs. subscription)
- Technology infrastructure is shifting from ATS to CRM to enable service delivery at scale

The remaining work is primarily about:
1. Completing brand voice/messaging (which guides customer communications)
2. Detailing the remaining page specifications (which guide product development)
3. Creating sales/marketing materials for the subscription model

The foundation is strong. The remaining work is systematic execution on documented plans.
