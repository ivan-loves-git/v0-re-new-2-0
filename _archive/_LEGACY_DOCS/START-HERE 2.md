# 🚀 START HERE - Re-New 2.0 Knowledge Repository

**Welcome to the Re-New operating system.** This repository is your single source of truth.

---

## 🎯 First Steps

1. **Read this file** (you are here)
2. **Read [KNOWLEDGE-SYSTEM.md](KNOWLEDGE-SYSTEM.md)** - The complete operating manual
3. **Check [00_CANONICAL/](00_CANONICAL/)** - Current strategic truth
4. **Review latest [04_MEETINGS/weekly-sync/](04_MEETINGS/weekly-sync/)** - Recent context

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: How to Change CANONICAL Files

### Files in `00_CANONICAL/` (Strategy, Brand, Operations, Knowledge)

**NEVER delete old content.** Instead:

1. Add new/updated content at the TOP of the relevant section
2. Move the old content to the BOTTOM of the file under a `## Change History` section
3. Strike through the old content using `~~strikethrough~~`
4. Add a timestamp and reason for the change

**Example:**

```markdown
## Business Model (Updated)

Our revenue model focuses on success-based fees from completed acquisitions...

---

## Change History

### Business Model (Previous - 2025-10-15)
~~We planned to charge candidates a flat tuition fee of €5,000...~~

**Changed:** 2025-10-24
**Reason:** Market validation showed candidates prefer success-based model; reduces barrier to entry
```

**Why this matters:**
- Preserves evolution of strategic thinking
- Shows what we learned and when
- Enables "why did we change course?" questions
- Maintains accountability and decision context

---

### Files in Other Folders (01-08)

**Can be updated normally** without change history:
- `01_WORKSTREAMS/` - Active work updates
- `02_ARTIFACTS/` - Deliverables (versioned separately)
- `03_DECISION_LOG/` - Immutable by design
- `04_MEETINGS/` - Point-in-time captures
- `05_INBOX/` - Temporary staging
- `06_SCRATCHPAD/` - Ephemeral workspace
- `07_ARCHIVE/` - Historical reference (read-only)
- `08_SYSTEM/` - Process templates

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

This repository implements **AI CoFounder principles**:

1. **Repo-first truth** → Everything lives here, not in Slack/email/heads
2. **Task-scoped context** → Load only what you need
3. **Artifacts over conversations** → Produce files you can ship
4. **Change history in CANONICAL** → Never lose strategic evolution
5. **Human review gates** → CANONICAL changes require approval
6. **Provenance tracking** → Every claim has a source

## 💡 Key Principles

**Single Source of Truth**
If it's not in this repo, it doesn't exist. No "tribal knowledge."

**Progressive Disclosure**
Start here → KNOWLEDGE-SYSTEM → specific docs. Don't overwhelm.

**Evolutionary Memory**
CANONICAL files show how our thinking evolved, not just current state.

**Trust but Verify**
Every claim needs a source. No hallucinations, no guesses.

**Work in Public (within team)**
Scratchpad is visible. Drafts are visible. Thinking is visible.
