## 💡 Tips for Completing Remaining Files

### Using the Template
1. Copy `02_PAGE_SPECIFICATIONS/_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Rename to page name (e.g., `login.md`)
3. Fill in each section systematically
4. Reference `signup.md` for detail level expectations

### Maintaining Consistency
- Use design system references ([03_DESIGN_SYSTEM/design-system.md](./03_DESIGN_SYSTEM/design-system.md))
- Keep navigation patterns consistent
- Reuse component descriptions where applicable

### Efficient Approaches
- **Group similar pages:** Document all hub pages together (similar structure)
- **Reuse content:** Many pages share components (forms, cards, lists)
- **Start simple:** Draft key sections first, add details later
- **Iterate:** Don't aim for perfection on first pass

### Quality Checks
- ✅ All sections in template completed
- ✅ Design system components referenced
- ✅ Accessibility notes included
- ✅ States documented (loading, error, empty, success)
- ✅ Navigation (FROM/TO) specified
