# Re-New 2.0 Project - Complete Documentation Exploration Report

**Report Date:** November 12, 2025
**Project:** Re-New 2.0 (Renew Dashboard - Acquisition Entrepreneur Platform)
**Focus:** Strategic documentation, business model, product specifications, and update requirements

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Re-New project has a **well-organized, professional documentation system** with clear CANONICAL (source of truth) files for strategy, brand, and operations. The project has undergone a **significant business model pivot** (November 2024) from a recruitment/selection model to a **subscription-based SaaS platform** serving acquisition entrepreneurs as direct customers.

### Key Status Points:
- **Business Model:** Transitioned from candidates-as-products to candidates-as-customers (subscription SaaS)
- **Product:** Dashboard MVP specifications documented (52 pages), partially implemented
- **Documentation:** Mature structure; strategic files updated, product specs in progress
- **Monetization:** Testing dual model (partner commissions + repreneur subscriptions) through May 2025
- **Technology:** Shifted from ATS → CRM infrastructure for relationship management

---

## 3. DECISION LOG & STRATEGIC PIVOTS

### Location: `/03_DECISION_LOG/`

**Critical Decisions (November 2024 - Dual Pivot Month):**

#### Decision 1: DEC-20241101-dual-monetization-testing.md
**Title:** "Test Both Monetization Streams Simultaneously"
- **Date:** Early November 2024
- **Decision:** Test partner-side (commission) + repreneur-side (subscription) monetization in parallel for 3-6 months
- **Why:** Insufficient data to choose between models; parallel testing accelerates learning
- **Experiment Duration:** November 2024 - May 2025
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Partner-side: ≥2/10 partners agree, ≥1 deal closes, ≥€25K revenue
  - Repreneur-side: ≥3/10 repreneurs pay, ≥€1K/month revenue, <50% churn

#### Decision 2: DEC-20241101-ats-to-crm-operational-pivot.md
**Title:** "ATS is Dead, CRM is the Future"
- **Date:** Early November 2024
- **Decision:** Shift from Applicant Tracking System (recruitment model) to Customer Relationship Management (service delivery model)
- **Rationale:** Campaign #2 proved Re-New is not in recruitment business; repreneurs are customers and products simultaneously
- **Tool:** Migrating from Airtable ATS structure to Airtable CRM module
- **Enablers:** Tracking service delivery, monetization status, partner relationships
- **Impact:** Enables managing 50-100+ repreneurs at scale (current: 35 active + 35 pipeline)

#### Other Decisions (2024-Q4):
- DEC-20241020-expansion-strategy-pivot.md - Exploration approach for geographic expansion

## 9. KEY INSIGHTS FOR UPDATING STRATEGY

### What's Already Updated (November 2024 Pivot)

✅ **Business Model** - Clearly articulates:
- Shift from candidates-as-products → candidates-as-customers
- Dual monetization being tested
- CRM infrastructure requirements
- Three-layer service model

✅ **Product Strategy** - Reflects:
- Subscription SaaS model (€99-349/month)
- Operating Partner retainer (€1,500-3,000/month post-acquisition)
- Full customer journey (Discovery → Acquisition → Post-Acq → Exit)

✅ **Target Audience** - Clear positioning:
- Mid-career professionals, not early-career
- Acquisition entrepreneurs ("repreneurs"), not "candidates"
- Value prop: Structure, community, expertise, opportunity

✅ **Strategic Framework** - Well documented:
- Three-phase GTM (Validate → Scale → Expand)
- Key assumptions for validation
- Expansion thesis (geographic, vertical)

### What Still Needs Attention

🔴 **Brand Voice & Messaging** - EMPTY, needs creation:
- How should we talk to customers?
- What's our tone? Professional? Empowering? Ambitious?
- Key messages for different customer segments?

🔴 **Page Specifications** - 47 of 52 pages not yet detailed
- MVP features critical for launch (Discovery, Deal Flow)
- Foundation good, just needs completion

🟡 **Marketing Materials** - Needs updating:
- Sales messaging for subscription model (not commission pitches)
- Customer acquisition strategy
- Success stories and case studies

## 11. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Brand Positioning (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Establish clear voice and messaging for subscription-based platform

1. **Create brand-voice.md**
   - Define tone: Professional yet approachable, ambitious, empowering
   - Create voice guidelines for different contexts (website copy, customer support, marketing)
   - Example voice traits: Structured, trustworthy, expert-backed, customer-obsessed

2. **Create key-messages.md**
   - Core message: "The structured path from SME acquisition aspiration to successful ownership"
   - Messages for different audiences:
     - Explorers (Starter tier): "Test your readiness with expert guidance"
     - Active Searchers (Professional tier): "Find the right deal with curated flow and expert support"
     - First-time Owners (Enterprise tier): "Succeed post-acquisition with operating partner coaching"
   - Success stories and social proof angles

3. **Create visual-identity.md**
   - Document any existing visual system (Figma design system reference)
   - Define color palette meaning, typography system, component standards
   - Ensure alignment with Asana-inspired design system

### Phase 2: Complete MVP Page Specifications (Week 2-6)
**Goal:** Define all MVP functionality for launch

**Priority (in order):**
1. Discovery: readiness-quiz, results, lead-de-cadrage (critical for onboarding)
2. Deal Flow: landing, browse, deal-detail, saved, pipeline (core value prop)
3. Settings: profile, subscription (required for SaaS)

**Effort:** ~41-57 hours
**Approach:** Use `_TEMPLATE.md` + reference `signup.md` for detail level

### Phase 3: Marketing & Sales Collateral (Week 6-8)
**Goal:** Materials for acquiring paying customers

1. Sales deck for subscription tiers (different from partner commission pitch)
2. Customer onboarding email sequences
3. FAQ and help documentation
4. Success stories/case studies from Cohort 1

### Phase 4: Monitor Monetization Experiments (Ongoing - Through May 2025)
**Goal:** Track dual monetization testing and update CANONICAL when decisions are made

- Partner-side results: Are M&A firms willing to pay commissions?
- Repreneur-side results: Are acquisition entrepreneurs willing to pay for platform access?
- Cannibalization effects: Are the two models conflicting?
- Update `business-model.md` in May 2025 with experimental results

## CONCLUSION

The Re-New project has a **mature, well-organized documentation foundation** with:

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clear strategic evolution documented with change history
- Well-defined target audience and value propositions
- Comprehensive product specifications (52 pages, partially detailed)
- Design system in place
- Decision log capturing major strategic pivots
- Proper folder structure supporting scalability

⚠️ **Areas Needing Attention:**
- Brand voice and key messages files are empty (creation needed)
- 47 of 52 page specifications need detailed completion (though batch specs exist)
- Marketing materials don't yet reflect subscription SaaS positioning
- Need to monitor and document dual monetization experiment results (through May 2025)

🎯 **Recommended Immediate Actions:**
1. Create brand voice, key messages, and visual identity files (core brand positioning)
2. Complete MVP page specifications (Discovery, Deal Flow, Settings)
3. Prepare marketing and sales materials for subscription launch
4. Set up process to capture monetization experiment results and update CANONICAL accordingly

The documentation system itself is excellent—well-structured, version-controlled, and designed for AI agent collaboration. The remaining work is primarily about completing the documented specifications and filling in the brand/messaging gaps.
